# Short Descriptions

I will take care of all short descriptions.
They are optional, but I want them to be consistent.

If you don't like what I put in one of the short descriptions or if it is wrong, let me know.

# The Story Is Optional

Having good stories though, is what makes the site consistent and much more worth while.

**Unless you want me to leave it blank, the story is the part I need help with.**

## Default Story

The default story is just a few sentences about work and school, whatever I can get from Facebook.

## Good Examples

For examples of the best stories, see the images in the galleries nearest the top of the list of "All" of them.
I am very happy with some of the stories in the Game of Thrones and Sopranos galleries, but they took a long time to write.

The stories about my parents were difficult to write.
They are very personal but they have a reasonably happy ending.

# Story Guidelines

Stories appear on the image page only.

- It should be as positive as possible.
- At the least, anything negative should have a corresponding positive aspect to balance it.

## Content

The story can contain html.  This means stories can contain links, quotes, headings, bullet or
numbered lists, images, videos, etc. - anything that can appear on a web page.

A photo or video of you would be excellent on your personal image page.

## Length

The story can be as long or as short as you like.

- I can leave it totally empty, which causes the button to be removed completely.
- If it is going to be more than one paragraph, it should have an arc: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## Quotes Are Excellent

I am finding it's best to put quotes in the stories on the site.  This makes the story more authentic and easier to do.

Do you have a favorite quote, or maybe a "theme song?"
Embedding a youtube video would be cool.

## Links Are Excellent

If you want to promote your business or a website, it would be great to link to that in the story.

- If you want to mention your favorite movie, tv show, band, sports team, etc., it would be fun to link to that in the story.
- If you want to get people join one of your social networking sites, it would be great to link to that to the story.

## Showing How It Applies: Most Excellent!

Describing how the colors and composition apply in your daily life would be most excellent - but is not required.

- If a hobby or other favorite activity applies, we should mention that.
- If any of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type resonates with you, that would be great to mention.
- Likewise, if any of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type DOES NOT resonate with you, that would be great to mention - but I'd want to have a positive to balance out any negativity.
- If you emphathize or idolize one or more of the fictional characters on the site, that would be great to mention.
- Likewise if you can't empathize with a fictional character that is the opposite type from you, that would be great to mention.
- If people frequently get the wrong impression of you somehow - especially if you're introverted - this would be a good time to "set the record straight."

# Conclusion

Thanks for helping add content to my site!

I have yet to monetize this idea, so can not offer any sort of payment, other than my gratitude.

I hope learning about all this enriches your life!
