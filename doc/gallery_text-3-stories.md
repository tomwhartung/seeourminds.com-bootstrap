This information is for the friends and family members who I've posted spiritual portraits of on [SeeOurMinds.com](https://SeeOurMinds.com/).

For more general information, see [part 1 of this series](https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/doc/gallery_text-1-general.md).

## Short Descriptions

I will take care of all [short descriptions](https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/doc/gallery_text-2-short_fields.md).
They are optional, but I want them to be consistent.

If you don't like what I put in one of the short descriptions or if it is wrong, let me know.

# Stories

**Unless you want me to leave it blank, the story is the part I need help with.**

## The Story Is Optional

They are optional, but having good [stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AP9nassRt2Y) is
what makes the site consistent and much more worth while.

## Default Story

The default story is just a few sentences about work and school, whatever I can get from Facebook.

## Good Examples

For examples of the best stories, see the images in the galleries nearest the top of the list of "All" of them.

- At this time, I am happiest with some of the stories in the Game of Thrones and Sopranos galleries
- These may take only a moment or two to read, but they took a long time to write!

### Examples of Good Friends and Family Stories

These stories were difficult to write, are very personal and a bit sad, but they have a reasonably happy ending.

- The stories about my Mom and Dad
- The stories about my late friends Jim and Eric

# Story Guidelines

Stories appear on the image page only.

- Stories should be as positive as possible
- At the least, anything negative should have a corresponding positive aspect to balance it

## Timing

At this time, only a few friends and family members have stories.

- If you want to be one of the first, let me know sooner rather than later
- If you want to wait and see what others do, check back in a few months or maybe next year

My only request is we write it before you die, so it says what you want it to say
and I avoid the saddness inherent in writing it posthumously.

## Content

The story can contain html.  This means stories can contain links, quotes, images, videos, headings, bullet or
numbered lists, etc. - anything that can appear on a web page.

A [photo](https://www.seeourminds.com/static/content/images/meat_portraits/Tom_Hartung-headshot-color.jpg) or
video of you would be excellent on your personal image page.

## Length

The story can be as long or as short as you like.

- I can leave it totally empty, which causes the button to be removed completely.
- A very short story is better than none at all.  If you just want to leave it at work and education, let me know and I'll remove the "I will share more information as it becomes available" boilerplate sentence and leave it at that.
- If it is going to be more than one paragraph, it should have an "arc:" a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## Quotes Are Excellent

I am finding it's best to put quotes in the stories on the site.  This makes the story more authentic and easier to do.

Do you have a favorite quote, or maybe a "theme song?"
Embedding a youtube video would be cool.

## Links Are Excellent

If you want to promote your business or a website, it would be great to link to that in the story.

- If you want to mention your favorite movie, tv show, band, church, sports team, etc., it would be fun to link to that in the story.
- If you want to get people join one of your social networking sites, it would be great to link to that to the story.

## Showing How It Applies: Most Excellent!

Describing how the colors and composition apply in your daily life would be most excellent - but is not required.

### What the Colors Mean

This idea is really not complicated, just different.

For a description of what the colors mean, see this article:

- https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/doc/language_of_seeourminds.md

### What the Four Letters Mean

There is ample information online about each type.
Favorite resources include the [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com).

**Clicking on any score on the site opens the corresponding page for that type in the wikipedia.**

### How it Applies

I can only guess at how the theory applies to your real life.
This is especially true for friends I have not seen in awhile.

So it is best that this comes from you.
Here are some ideas:

- If a hobby or other favorite activity applies, we should mention that.
- If any of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type resonates with you, that would be great to mention.
- Likewise, if any of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type DOES NOT resonate with you, that would be great to mention - but I'd want to have a positive to balance out any negativity.
- If you emphathize or idolize one or more of the fictional characters on the site, that would be great to mention.
- Likewise if you can't empathize with a fictional character that is the opposite type from you, that would be great to mention.
- If people frequently get the wrong impression of you somehow - especially if you're introverted - this would be a good time to "set the record straight."

## Describing How Long Term Relationships Can Work Despite Differences: Most Excellent as Well!

Opposites attract, but can cause difficulties in communications.
If you are a member of one of the couples posted on the site, it would be great to know how you achieve this longevity
in light of your underlying similarities and differences.

# Conclusion

Thanks for helping add content to my site!

I have yet to monetize this idea, so can not offer any sort of payment, other than my gratitude.

I hope learning about all this enriches your life!
