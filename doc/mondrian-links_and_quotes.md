## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*Emphasis in original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> ....
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

> [T]he equilibrium in the new art is ... *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite tehir different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> ....
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(p. 257)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
(p. 260)

> *[C]oncrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to givit first attention.*
(p. 263)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
(p. 265)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
(p. 266)

> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give u p their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great mesage of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)

## Introduction to The New Art - The New Life (1932)

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create
> universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.*
> These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the
> beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.
> This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.
(p. 278)

> Until now the search for universal equilibrium has been neglected in favor of individual interests.
> Art demonstrates that, as long as these dominate, world equilibrium cannot exist.
> To achieve universal equilibrium, the new art had to sacrifice the beauty of limiting and particular form in order to
> establish equivalent relationships through their universal aspect of color and line.
(p. 280)

This introduction ends with a paragraph that addresses people who are not ready for abstract art.

## Neo-Plastic (1938)

> Neo-Plastic reduces particular form to its fundamental elements, that is, to straight lines in rectangular opposition.
> We then can say that Neo-Plastic annihilates limited form and creates pure relationships.
> For in Neo-Plastic composition, the straight lines constantly intersect each other,
> so that the rectangles apparently formed are not asserted as such.
> The relationships are established determinately.  Color is primary.
> Because of the inherent consistency of the plastic means, there is real equivalence between these means and
> the space represented by the ground [*le fond*]: the work is a unity.
> The relationship of position - the right angle - is constant.
> Through opposition, the relationships of dimension vary continually so that all symmetry can be destroyed.
> Precisely through these variable relationships in Neo-Plastic composition,
> the static character of the constant relationship is annihilated and the work can be dynamic and truly human.
(p. 305)

## Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life (1939-1940)

> When we view the tragic events of war, pessimism overtakes us and makes it difficult to think of culture.
> The effect of actual events weakens our confidence in the progress of life.
> Where is to be found, despite this, a true optimism concerning humanity's future?
> If we are able to understand the culture of plastic art as a continuous growth toward the full
> utilization of its freedom to express pure life, then one way to optimism is open to humanity.
> The culture of art reveals to us that life is a continual growth, an irresistable progress.
> In spite of all, human culture must manifest what the culture of art demonstrates: continual progress.
> But subjective factors prevent this from being seen.  It is seen only as continual change.

-- from Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life, by Piet Mondrian, 1939-40.
