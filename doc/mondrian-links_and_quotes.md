## Introduction to The New Art - The New Life (1932)

Note: although he wrote this introduction **after** writing the book (in 1931), it appears after this, because it is the Introduction.

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create
> universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.*
> These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the
> beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.
> This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.
(p. 278)

> Until now the search for universal equilibrium has been neglected in favor of individual interests.
> Art demonstrates that, as long as these dominate, world equilibrium cannot exist.
> **To achieve universal equilibrium, the new art had to sacrifice the beauty of limiting and particular form in order to
> establish equivalent relationships through their universal aspect of color and line.**
(p. 280)

This introduction ends with a paragraph that addresses people who are not ready for abstract art.

## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*All emphasis is in the original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more or less purified,
> not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

> Today we see subject and particular form, once of such great importance in the work,
> rejected not only as being a primitive means of expression, but also as limiting expression.
> Until now their use has been prolongd by tradition and necessity - equally by convention and inertia.
(p. 249)

In this evolution of art and life it is sincerity, rather than conformity, that matters:

> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.
> Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*
(p. 249)

> By using subject matter or even particular form alone, figurative art always shows a descriptive,
> literary side that veils the purely plastic expression of line, color, and relationships.
(p. 251)

> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word "equilibrium" has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> It is therefore of great importance for humanity that art manifest in an exact way the constant but varying
> rhythm of opposition of the two principal aspects of all life.
> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> The new life will attain this liberty materially and spiritually.
> Although joined to others by mutual equivalent relationships, the individual will be no less free,
> because of the equivalence of these relationships.
>
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> Art in its end shows that individual liberty - until now an "ideal" - will become reality in the distant future.
> This requires a stage of evolution in which man will no longer abuse his liberty.
(p. 255)

> By following the rhythm of the two contrary oppositions of the straight line, we can say
> that the real life basic to man is simply the action of equilibrated opposition - for example,
> the double movement of respiration, which is contrary and complementary.
> It is a pure expression of vital rhythm....
(p. 256)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(pp. 256-257)

> With regard to limiting forms, it is not only conventional forms that constitute obstacles to the new life,
> but so do most of the new forms arising in political, social, and economic areas.
> For instance, aristocratic limitations are re-created under democratic forms, and "socialism" often proves
> synonymous with bourgeoisie.
> And with regard to equivalence, we can say that modern man, although cultivated and refined,
> despite his spiritual improvement is not of really new mentality if he fails to seek equivalence.
(p. 257)

> Whether we conceive life as joy or as suffering depends on which is most important to us: abolition or creation.
>
> The beauty and the misery of concrete life consists precisely in the fact that we can escape neither abolition nor creation,
> thus neither joy nor suffering.
(p. 259)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
>
> But in concrete life good and evil oppose each other.
> And it is also a characteristic of life's beauty and misery that we can escape neither one.
(p. 260)

> But the new art also reveals another thing of the greatest importance: *to show ourselves as we really are.*
> It reveals that frankness and sincerity are the primordial conditions for the new life.
(p. 260)

> Nothing is more unfortunate for life than the concealment of reality: truth.
> Since life is truth, life is then concealed.
(p. 260)

> By enclosing ourselves within the small circle of what is agreeable to us, we unjustly separate ourselves from others,
> from universal life and all its beauties, which then remain concealed.
(p. 261)

> The actions of creation and abolition will become increasingly united,
> so that more and more we will be able to create by abolishing.
>
> Gradually the long periods of abolition and of creation will diminish;
> gradually peace and war will become one and annihilate each other.
> As we appropach *equivalence of the two contrary aspects within us and outside us,*
> we will gradually be less "lived by" life and become more capable of "living."
(p. 261)

> The culture of art clearly shows that life is *continual transformation* in the sense of growth from birth until death.
> Nothing recurs in the same way, nor remains the same.  Thus *life itself is opposed to all conservatism.*
> Only for a time do the new forms recur in a similar way.  Yet, are they actually similar?
> The fact that they often seem identical sustains the conservative mentality, and causes error.
>
> Certainly, conservative action is present in life but always opposed to creative action,
> so that each annihilates the other, and progress - growth - continues.
(p. 261)

> The perfecting of science is one of the principal ways by which human progress leads to a more equilibrated state.
(p. 262)

> In all areas of life, social and economic, we must create new organizations - not in the old way,
> dominated by other organizations - but as true socialism envisages, *self-governed organizations composed of
> producers and consumers in equivalent mutual relationships.*
(p. 262)

> The creation of the machine itself proves that man has already lost much of his animal force and has therefore sought to replace it.
> The machine can free man from his state of slavery.
>
> This cannot happen in a single day.
> But in time the machine can restore man to himself.
> For man *does not live in order to work; he works in order to "live."*
(p. 262)

> The content of Western culture is above all to make man conscious.
>
> Man was not originally conscious of the life deep within him, which we have called "real life" (the essential in man).
> He was more or less conscious of the concrete side of life - the physical, the sensual, the intellectual.
> *Therefore, concrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to give it first attention.*
(p. 263)

> If life and art demonstrate that evolution takes place through the action of creation and abolition,
> then all the miseries and all the advantages brought by the progress of civilization *are so many necessities for man's evolution.*
> But we generally see only one or the other of these two actions: thus life is seen either as declining or as unchanging.
> Creation alone would mean no change, and abolition alone would mean ruin.
> But those who see both actions as reciprocal understand life as *eternal growth.*
(p. 264)

> The more human progress asserts itself, the more violently does natural instinct fight against it.
> For progress involves *diminishing the privileges of the natural state.*
>
> This explains the present hostility to all manifestations of progress and the reactionary efforts in art and in life.
>
> These arise from a narrow conception, from a failure to see clearly.  One does not see the improvement progress brings.
> One is not aware that despite all its defects - which are simply vestiges of man's primitive state - the true content of life
> not only remains intact but sheds its harmful disguises.
(pp. 264-265)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
> If kings were just, a republic would be no better than a monarchy.
(p. 265)

> In life as in art, we must reckon with reality.  Not all men are just.
> That is why those who are just must try *to elevate the true and the just in man,
> must strive to create situations favorable to this development, and must attempt to
> establish a mutual organization that prevents disequilibrium and constrains man to be just in his social relationships.*
>
> By transforming social organization, we transform the individual.
> Those who attempt to oppose the new order will nevertheless be obliged to follow it.
> There will be nothing despotic in this constraint.
> And in a probably distant future, order will be imposed only by *mutual necessity.*
(p. 265)

> The day will come when the individual will be capable of governing himself.  The new art demonstrates all this.
(p. 265)

> General concentration upon proper and mutual relationships is the way to solve all the problems of society.
(p. 266)

> Concentration on the mutual relationships of social life will change our conception of life, and thus our efforts.
> Instead of complaining, for instance, that men of our time are interested only in making money by any means,
> we must try to create social and economic circumstances that not only prefent them from resorting to unjust means,
> but will actually impose just means and make them possible.
> Because of corrupt conditions, man is often pressed, if not forced, to be exclusively preoccupied with money.
> Money, that invaluable means of civilization, should be only a "means of exchange" and not
> assume a *limiting form* that oppresses and debases other forms of life.
(p. 266)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Already, today's disequilibrated social and economic conditions show that this form has matured and is about to transform itself.
> This form, instead of becoming open, so as to make possible an equivalent distribution of values,
> will probably remain a "form" - as art clearly shows by its transformation of particular form into
> purified form before its destruction of all limited form.
> Although a more stable world equilibrium will follow, the new form will still be too dominated by money to allow it to
> spread equivalently through the world.
> For the future, Neo-Plastic demonstrates for every area *an organization of equivalent relationships and not a new form.*
(p. 266)

This is a good quote to support using spiritual portraits for transparency and better relationships:

> Love and friendship play an important role in mutual nonequivalent exchange.
> The new art demonstrates that in order to achieve real equivalence the oppositions of a relationship must be pure.
> To become pure they must first be separated, that is, disengaged from whatever they are confounded with.
>
> When the two aspects of life are confounded, hypocrisy controls and betrays us.
> This is why it is enormously important for the new art to establish *purified forms and pure relationships:
> they do not conceal, they are real and show themselves for what they are.*
(p. 267)

> In communal life the question will always arise whether all are capable of contributing equivalent value if they
> lack the physical or mental power; physically, for example, old people, children, and especially the sick.
> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give up their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

> Why do we not outlaw all arms making and destroy all weapons now existing in our "civilized" society?
> With weapons outlawed, it would be far less easy for men to kill each other.
> But in our society so many make their fortunes or live by these barbaric instruments.
> Again it is *particular interest* that sustains war.
(p. 268)

> In politics it is not enough to work toward internally equivalent relationships, we must above all
> achieve equivalent relationships of international order.
>
> In art, Neo-Plastic demonstrates this necessity most exactly.
> Through intersecting lines, the mutual relationships destroy each plane's separateness so that all unite completely.
>
> The rectangular planes of varying dimensions and colors visibly demonstrate that *internationalism* does not mean
> chaos ruled by monotony but an ordered and clearly divided unity.
> In Neo-Plastict there are, in fact, very definite boundaries.
(p. 268-269)

> Although Neo-Plastic establishes the goal of human culture, this goal points the way for tomorrow.
> And if the mutual equality that Neo-Plastic manifests cannot be realized in life today,
> the new art nevertheless shows that pure forms and relationships can be established,
> and thus a *new organization* that already makes possible a freer and more really unified life.
(p. 269)

> Religion became a limiting form, as the church, but shows its true content as it progressively frees itself from
> its trappings in the course of human culture.
> If art demonstrates that the mutual separation of forms increases their intrinsic value and produces a more perfect union,
> we can also note with satisfaction that the separation of church and state, the separation of religion from learning or philosophy.
> Liberated and restored to independence, everything more easily achieves profundity.
(p. 269)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> Conventional morality, however, is not the pure expression of high universal morality.
> Just as in the figurative work of art, purely plastic expression is not only confused but distorted,
> so in life conventional morality is confused and distored by enclosing itself within its various forms.
(p. 270)

> What high universal morality - which is an expression of human evolution - requires is
> precisely *the same thing that life* - which is equally an expression of human evolution - demands.
(p. 270)

> High universal morality missed its goal because of the limited understanding of men, whose very nature must oppose it.
> This is very logical because high universal morality is not the essential expression of the culture of the past,
> which is characterized as the culture of particular form.
> Despite the fact that high universal morality could not be realized, men nevertheless sought to impose it in the
> form of conventional morality.
> Thus arose all the hypocritical and corrupt conditions for which life has been the scene.
(p. 270)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

> If the culture of particular form creates and cultivates this form and equally destroys it,
> morality must accord with this double action.  *It must accept evil as well as good.*
>
> But the distorted or confused morality of the past could not accept evil and considered it to be abnormal, a disease, a defect of life.
(p. 271)

> Toward the end of the culture of particular forms, high universal morality - which basically contains
> only good - appears to dictate that we must do evil to these forms.
> But actually, it envisages only the establishment of pure and equivalent relationships, and therefore requires purified forms.
(p. 271)

> The new morality therefore demands that we *accept the abolition of oppressive particular forms;*
> in this sense it is for a time *a morality of evil.*
> But it is against the mutual abolition of particular forms to the point of their total destruction,
> because the new culture needs *what is essential in these forms* for its new creation.
>
> The new morality therefore requires that we recognize evil as being basically good.
> For high universal morality transcends the limitations of time.
(p. 271)

> Because of the need to secure his personal existence, man, egoist by nature, will remain so throughout his evolution.
> But in the course of evolution, egoism at the expense of others is increasingly transformed into egoism directly benefiting all.
(p. 273)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great message of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
>
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)

> As the new life approaches, a new morality is clearly being established, clearly founded on the new culture revealed by life and by art.
> During the culture of equivalent relationships, it will be based on the apogee of this culture, that is,
> on the realization of *equivalent mutual relationships* that the new life will attain.
>
> The new morality is that of *social life* in contrast to the morality of the past,
> which strove toward the same goal but in reality fostered only particular life, individual or collective.
> While the morality of the past was sustained by church and state, the new morality is sustained by society.
> Its content, conceived abstractly, is *universal international justice.*
(p. 274)

## Neo-Plastic (1938)

> Neo-Plastic reduces particular form to its fundamental elements, that is, to straight lines in rectangular opposition.
> We then can say that Neo-Plastic annihilates limited form and creates pure relationships.
> For in Neo-Plastic composition, the straight lines constantly intersect each other,
> so that the rectangles apparently formed are not asserted as such.
> The relationships are established determinately.  Color is primary.
> Because of the inherent consistency of the plastic means, there is real equivalence between these means and
> the space represented by the ground [*le fond*]: the work is a unity.
> The relationship of position - the right angle - is constant.
> Through opposition, the relationships of dimension vary continually so that all symmetry can be destroyed.
> Precisely through these variable relationships in Neo-Plastic composition,
> the static character of the constant relationship is annihilated and the work can be dynamic and truly human.
(p. 305)

## Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life (1939-1940)

> When we view the tragic events of war, pessimism overtakes us and makes it difficult to think of culture.
> The effect of actual events weakens our confidence in the progress of life.
> Where is to be found, despite this, a true optimism concerning humanity's future?
> If we are able to understand the culture of plastic art as a continuous growth toward the full
> utilization of its freedom to express pure life, then one way to optimism is open to humanity.
> The culture of art reveals to us that life is a continual growth, an irresistable progress.
> In spite of all, human culture must manifest what the culture of art demonstrates: continual progress.
> But subjective factors prevent this from being seen.  It is seen only as continual change.

-- from Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life, by Piet Mondrian, 1939-40.
