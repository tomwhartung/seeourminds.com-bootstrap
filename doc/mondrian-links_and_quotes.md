## The New Art - The New Life: Thc Culture of Pure Relationships

*Emphasis in original.*

> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*

> [T]he equilibrium in the new art is ... *a continuatious and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminisjhes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*

> The rhythmof the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite tehir different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*



## Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life (1939-1940)

> When we view the tragic events of war, pessimism overtakes us and makes it difficult to think of culture.
> The effect of actual events weakens our confidence in the progress of life.
> Where is to be found, despite this, a true optimism concerning humanity's future?
> If we are able to understand the culture of plastic art as a continuous growth toward the full
> utilization of its freedom to express pure life, then one way to optimism is open to humanity.
> The culture of art reveals to us that life is a continual growth, an irresistable progress.
> In spite of all, human culture must manifest what the culture of art demonstrates: continual progress.
> But subjective factors prevent this from being seen.  It is seen only as continual change.

-- from Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life, by Piet Mondrian, 1939-40.
