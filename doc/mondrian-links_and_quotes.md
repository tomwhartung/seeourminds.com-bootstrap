# Quotes

> When we view the tragic events of war, pessimism overtakes us and makes it difficult to think of culture.
> The effect of actual events weakens our confidence in the progress of life.
> Where is to be found, despite this, a true optimism concerning humanity's future?
> If we are able to understand the culture of plastic art as a continuous growth toward the full
> utilization of its freedom to express pure life, then one way to optimism is open to humanity.
> The culture of art reveals to us that life is a continual growth, an irresistable progress.
> In spite of all, human culture must manifest what the culture of art demonstrates: continual progress.
> But subjective factors prevent this from being seen.  It is seen only as continual change.
-- from Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life, by Piet Mondrian, 1939-40.
