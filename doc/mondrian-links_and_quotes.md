## The New Art - The New Life: The Culture of Pure Relationships (1931)

Written over a period of three years, based on ideas developed over the previous decade, but never published during his lifetime.

*All emphasis is in the original.*

> If art is an expression of life and anticipates it, we can state that the new life is *the culture of equivalent relationships.*
> Just as with the plastic means in art, it is evident that for this life our mentality must become more ore less purified,
> not in an old-fashioned puritanical way, but so as to rise above the oppression of limiting, particular forms.
> Thus in the same way as art, life reaches a state of real equilibrium
> *through pure and equivalent relationships of increasingly free individuals.*
(p. 248)

> Today we see subject and particular form, once of such great importance in the work,
> rejected not only as being a primitive means of expression, but also as limiting expression.
> Until now their use has been prolongd by tradition and necessity - equally by convention and inertia.
(p. 249)

In this evolution of art and life it is sincerity, rather than conformity, that matters:

> In life every sincere effort leads to human evolution, and it is the same in art.
> Rightly seen, there remains *a single path of evolution* that, regardless of time, *is identical for life and for art.*
(p. 249)

> However, even in the new aesthetic, the word "equilibrium" has caused many misunderstandings and repeated errors.
> The only way to correct them will be by attentive study of the plastic expression of the new art.
> It will be seen that the equilibrium in the new art is not a static state without action, as is generally thought but,
> on the contrary, *a continuous and mutually annihilating opposition of equivalent but unequal elements.*
(p. 252)

> *The physical aspect of man, of life, diminishes in opposition to the spiritual aspect, which becomes stronger.*
(p. 254)

> It is therefore of great importance for humanity that art manifest in an exact way the constant but varying
> rhythm of opposition of the two principal aspects of all life.
> The rhythm of the straight line in rectangular opposition indicates
> *the need for equivalence* of these two aspects in life: *the equal value of the material and spiritual,
> the masculine and feminine, the collective and individual, etc.*
> Just as the vertical line differes in character from the horizontal, so in life the two aspects have their inherent and opposed character.
> But just as in art these lines have different dimensions, so individuals and their groups differ in strength or size.
> *Art demonstrates that life, through equivalence of its opposed aspects - despite their different nature - can approach real equilibrium.*
(p. 254)

> Art demonstrates that the true realization of real life requires *individual liberty.*
> The new life will attain this liberty materially and spiritually.
> Although joined to others by mutual equivalent relationships, the individual will be no less free,
> because of the equivalence of these relationships.
> The new art gives *independent existence* to line and color in that they are *neither oppressed nor deformed by particular form,* but
> establish their own limitations *appropriate to their nature.*
> Likewise, in future life society will allow each individual in *independent existence consistent with his own character.*
(p. 255)

> When we understand the equivalence of contrary oppositions of art's rhythm, we work more consciously to build truly human life.
> For least attention is given to establishing equilibrium through *equivalence of the two fundamental oppositions.*
(p. 257)

> Whether we conceive life as joy or as suffering depends on which is most important to us: abolition or creation.
> The beauty and the misery of concrete life consists precisely in the fact that we can escape neither abolition nor creation,
> thus neither joy nor suffering.
(p. 259)

> If evil is synonymous with abolition and thus with suffering, and
> good is synonymous with creation and thus with joy, then in real life good and evil destroy each other.
> But in concrete life good and evil oppose each other.
> And it is also a characteristic of life's beauty and misery that we can escape neither one.
(p. 260)

> Nothing is more unfortunate for life than the concealment of reality: truth.
> Since life is truth, life is then concealed.
(p. 260)

> By enclosing ourselves within the small circle of what is agreeable to us, we unjustly separate ourselves from others,
> from universal life and all its beauties, which then remain concealed.
(p. 261)

> The actions of creation and abolition will become increasingly united,
> so that more and more we will be able to create by abolishing.
> Gradually the long periods of abolition and of creation will diminish;
> gradually peace and war will become one and annihilate each other.
> As we appropach *equivalence of the two contrary aspects within us and outside us,*
> we will gradually be less "lived by" life and become more capable of "living."
(p. 261)

> The perfecting of science is one of the principal ways by which human progress leads to a more equilibrated state.
(p. 262)

> The machine can free man from his state of slavery.  This cannot happen in a single day.
> But in time the machine can restore man to himself.  For man *does not live in order to work; he works in order to "live."*
(p. 262)

> *[C]oncrete life is our actual human life, and it is logical that we are constrained to givit first attention.*
(p. 263)

> If life and art demonstrate that evolution takes place through the action of creation and abolition,
> then all the miseries and all the advantages brought by the progresss of civilization *are so many necessities for man's evolution.*
> But we generally see only one or the other of these two actions: thus life is seen either as declining or as unchanging.
> Creation alone would mean no change, and abolition alone would mean ruin.
> But those who see both actions as reciprocal understand life as *eternal growth.*
(p. 264)

> If all men were just and honest, all would be well and universal equilibrium would be spontaneously established.
(p. 265)

> Capitalism as cultivated until now is a limiting form that is abolishing itself and
> will be abolished in the culture of equivalent relationships.
(p. 266)

> A just solution must be found, for all human beings are basically equal and all are entitled to an equivalent existence.
> This is not achieved by charity or love or friendship, for these qualities cannot create pure relationships.
> *The essential value of each individual entitles him to an existence equivalent to that of others;*
> if disabled, he must be supported *in keeping with the value* that he is unable to realize; he is a communal responsibility.
> This is important not only for those who are incapable of contributing equivalent values,
> but also for the others who, being assured of a livelihood, will have the strength to cultivate themselves,
> to live their own lives, that is, to give u p their dependence upon limiting forms.
> The entire community would thus benefit.
(p. 267)

> Just as art itself has slowly created a new plastic expression of more real equilibrium,
> life itself will slowly create this equilibrium in a new social and economic organization.
(p. 269)

> High universal morality finds its expression in the apogee of the culture of equivalent relationships.
> Art in its end demonstrates that only line and color free from all oppression of form can constitute equivalent relationships.
> Thus in life only the free individual and groups of free individuals can form a mutually equivalent organization and
> become capable of realizing the content of high universal morality, which prescibes that we live for each and for all.
(p. 270)

**This sums it up quite nicely:**

> Every day we are astonished by the complete absence of true love, friendship, brotherhood, kindness.
> Centuries and centuries ago the great mesage of universal love was proclaimed: although its influence is undeniable, man has not changed.
> Therefore, let us not insist upon what has shown itself as unrealizable.
> Art demonstrates that *life impels humanity toward equivalence of its two opposed aspects and
> thus toward the destruction of individual limitations.*
> This is how life can realize the high ideals proclaimed so long ago.
(p. 273)

## Introduction to The New Art - The New Life (1932)

> The culture of art demonstrates that only *man's development* in the distant future can create
> universal equilibrium through the *establishment of equivalent relationships.*
> These relationships are already realized in pure art - art free from figuration and all limiting form - expressing the
> beauty of equivalent relationships exclusively through pure line and color.
> This art is an image of the ideal human goal toward which humanity is moving.
(p. 278)

> Until now the search for universal equilibrium has been neglected in favor of individual interests.
> Art demonstrates that, as long as these dominate, world equilibrium cannot exist.
> To achieve universal equilibrium, the new art had to sacrifice the beauty of limiting and particular form in order to
> establish equivalent relationships through their universal aspect of color and line.
(p. 280)

This introduction ends with a paragraph that addresses people who are not ready for abstract art.

## Neo-Plastic (1938)

> Neo-Plastic reduces particular form to its fundamental elements, that is, to straight lines in rectangular opposition.
> We then can say that Neo-Plastic annihilates limited form and creates pure relationships.
> For in Neo-Plastic composition, the straight lines constantly intersect each other,
> so that the rectangles apparently formed are not asserted as such.
> The relationships are established determinately.  Color is primary.
> Because of the inherent consistency of the plastic means, there is real equivalence between these means and
> the space represented by the ground [*le fond*]: the work is a unity.
> The relationship of position - the right angle - is constant.
> Through opposition, the relationships of dimension vary continually so that all symmetry can be destroyed.
> Precisely through these variable relationships in Neo-Plastic composition,
> the static character of the constant relationship is annihilated and the work can be dynamic and truly human.
(p. 305)

## Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life (1939-1940)

> When we view the tragic events of war, pessimism overtakes us and makes it difficult to think of culture.
> The effect of actual events weakens our confidence in the progress of life.
> Where is to be found, despite this, a true optimism concerning humanity's future?
> If we are able to understand the culture of plastic art as a continuous growth toward the full
> utilization of its freedom to express pure life, then one way to optimism is open to humanity.
> The culture of art reveals to us that life is a continual growth, an irresistable progress.
> In spite of all, human culture must manifest what the culture of art demonstrates: continual progress.
> But subjective factors prevent this from being seen.  It is seen only as continual change.

-- from Liberation from Oppression in Art and Life, by Piet Mondrian, 1939-40.
