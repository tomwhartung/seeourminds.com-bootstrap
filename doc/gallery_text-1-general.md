Following is an overview of the text and link fields that appear in galleries on the SeeOurMinds.com site.

# Goals

These are the goals of all descriptive text on the site:

1. **Honesty** - to the point of complete transparency
2. Keep it positive **without violating goal 1**
3. Put each tidbit of information [in its right place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvMql9XgIg0)

# Ideally and Realistically

Ideally, each image should be able to stand on its own.

Realistically, without some sort of context, each image is "just a bunch of squares."

# The Strategy: Compromise

I use the following compromises to balance the ideal with reality:

- Hide some or even most of the text until the visitor clicks on a button to see it
- Have several specific short descriptions
  - Teaser on galleries list page (click to see gallery)
  - Teaser on gallery page (click to see image)
  - Explain the Dominant function - on image page
  - Explain the Auxiliary function - on image page
- Have a long story for each image
  - Story intro text acts as another teaser, but in reality it functions a bit differently...

Having text concealed behind buttons allows me to use Google Analytics to learn which fields visitors are actually looking at.

# All Fields Are Optional

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

- In general, the more information we can offer about an image the better.
- The fact that the visitor must click a button to see the information means they want to learn more.
  - This does **not** mean it's ok to go on and on and on and on.

Moreover, the content of all fields should be specific and consistent across all images.

# All Text Fields Are Important

All fields are important, but some are more important than others.

- Each field serves a specific purpose
- Some are text only, some can accomodate html

Again though, for consistency it is important to try to fill in something for each of them on all images.

## 1. Most Important Fields: Titles, Teasers, and Explanations

The most important fields, in order of their importance, are:

1. Image title - name of person whose personality the image represents.  No links allowed.
2. Image sub title - a bit more about the person, what they do, etc.  May contain a link.
3. Image teaser text on gallery page - why the visitor should see the larger version of it.
4. The "Explain the [color]" buttons - explain the most prevalent colors in the image.

## 2. Story is of Medium Importance

The stories can really help visitors understand the person, and hence the image.
However, they can be rather personal, and difficult and time-consuming to write.

For details about stories, see:

## 3. Least Important Fields: Link Buttons

The least important fields are at the bottom of the page, under the score:

- Link to the "Meat Portrait"
  - This link sounds condescending on purpose and is best used for fictional and famous characters
  - Instead of using this, friends and family should consider embeding one or more images or videos in their story
- "Compare To" Link - for couples, this should link to the spouse's image page
- "Contrast With" Link - best when linked to some with an opposite personality, e.g., Woody Allen (INFP) and Tony Soprano (ESTJ)

# Use of Pronouns

## Stories: OK to Use First Person

Stories are personal so it is OK to use first person (I, me, etc.).

For consistency with all other stories, the first person refers to me, Tom Hartung, the creator of the site.

## OK to Use Second Person in Stories, If Desired

At this time, I see no reason to use second person (you, etc.) pronouns.

However if a situation arises in which using the second person in a story is appropriate, it is ok to do so.

## All Other Text Fields: *NO* First or Second Person!

All fields other than the stories are "objective" and
**must NOT use any first person** (I, me, etc.) or **second person** (you, etc.) pronouns.

## Third Person Pronouns Must **Not** Be Ambiguous

Any third person pronouns (he, she, etc.) **must be unambiguous** with regards to whether they refer to the
person whose image is displayed or other individuals in the world at large.

# Conclusion

## The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly

I fully understand that many people may not "get" the images, at least not at first.
I fully understand that some people will refuse to open themselves to this idea.

My response to these people is, as described in the following series of articles on https://medium.com/@seeourminds ,

## Examples Are the Key

I do believe that with enough examples, after a while, people will get it!

I do believe I just need enough examples of people that "everyone knows" and people will start to understand them without the text!

Because when it comes right down to it, it's really quite simple: just a language with six terms:

## Thanks!

Thank you very much for your kind and open-minded attention to all this, my *magnum opus!*
