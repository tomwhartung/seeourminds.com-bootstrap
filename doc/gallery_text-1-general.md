Following is an overview of the text and link fields that appear in galleries on the SeeOurMinds.com site.

# Goals

These are the goals of all descriptive text on the site:

1. Honesty to the Point of Transparency
2. Keep It Positive **Without Violating Goal 1**
3. Put each tidbit of information in the correct place

# Ideally and Realistically

Ideally, each image should be able to stand on its own.

Realistically, without some sort of context, each image is "just a bunch of squares."

# The Strategy: Compromise

I use the following compromises to balance the ideal with reality:

- Hide some or even most of the text until the visitor clicks on a button to see it
- Have several specific short descriptions
- - Teaser on galleries list page (click to see gallery)
- - Teaser on gallery page (click to see image)
- - Explain the Dominant function - on image page
- - Explain the Auxiliary function - on image page
- Have a long story for each image
- - Intro text acts as a teaser of sorts

Having buttons allows me to use Google Analytics to learn which fields visitors are actually looking at.

# All Fields Are Optional

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

- In general, the more information we can offer about an image the better.

The fact that the visitor must click a button to see the information means they want to learn more.
This does not mean it's ok to go on and on and on and on....

# All Text Fields Are Important

All fields are important, but some are more important than others.

- Each field serves a specific purpose
- Some are text only, some can accomodate html
- For consistency it is important to try to fill in all of them

## 1. Most Important Fields: Titles, Teasers, and Explanations

The most important fields, in order of their importance, are:

1. Image title - name of person whose personality the image represents.  No links allowed.
2. Image sub title - a bit more about the person, what they do, etc.  May contain a link.
3. Image teaser text on gallery page - why the visitor should see the larger version of it.
4. The "Explain the [color]" buttons - explain the most prevalent colors in the image.

## 2. Story is of Medium Importance

The stories can really help visitors understand the person, and hence the image.
However, they can be rather personal, and difficult and time-consuming to write.

For details about stories, see Part 4 of this series:

## 3. Least Important Fields: Link Buttons

The least important fields are:

- Link to the "Meat Portrait"
  - This link sounds condescending on purpose
  - If desired, friends can embed one or more images in the story
- "Compare To" Link
- "Contrast With" Link

# Use of Pronouns

## Stories: OK to Use First Person

Stories are personal so it is OK to use first person (I, me, etc.) and second person (you, etc.) pronouns.

Note that the words "I," "me," etc. refer to me, Tom Hartung, the Site's creator.

## All Other Text Fields: *NO* First or Second Person!

All fields other than the stories are "objective" and
**must NOT use any first person** (I, me, etc.) or **second person** (you, etc.) pronouns.

## Third Person Pronouns **Must** Be Unambiguous

Any third person pronouns (he, she, etc.) **must be unambiguous** with regards to whether they refer to the
person whose image is displayed or other individuals in the world at large.

# Conclusion

I fully understand that many people may not "get" the images, at least not at first.

I fully understand that some people will, after a while, get to grokking the images.
The idea is really quite simple, and enough examples of people that "everyone knows"
will help people understand them without the text.

## Assholes Will Be Assholes

I fully understand that some people will refuse to open themselves to this idea.

- Not everyone enjoys abstract thought the way I do.
- It's easy to anticipate some religious people might take exception to the term "spiritual portrait,"
if it doesn't include their specific religious icon, or whatever.
- It's the internet, so people are always getting pissed off for no reason.  "Oh Well."
