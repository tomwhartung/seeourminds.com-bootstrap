Following is an overview of the text and link fields that appear in galleries on the SeeOurMinds.com site.

# Goals

These are the goals of all descriptive text on the site:

1. Transparency
2. Putting each tidbit of information in the correct place

# Ideally and Realistically

Ideally, each image should be able to stand on its own.

Realistically, without some sort of context, each image is "just a bunch of squares."

# The Strategy: Compromise

I use the following compromises to balance the ideal with reality:

- Have several specific short descriptions
- Have a long story for each image
- Hide most of the text until the visitor clicks on a button to see it

Having buttons allows me to use Google Analytics to learn which fields visitors are actually looking at.

# All Fields Are Optional

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

In general, the more information I can offer about an image the better.

The fact that the visitor must click a button to see the information means they want to learn more.
This does not mean it's ok to go on and on and on and on....

# All Text Fields Are Important

All fields are important, but some are more important than others.

- Each field serves a specific purpose
- Some are text only, some can accomodate html
- For consistency it is important to try to fill in all of them

## The Most Important Fields: Titles, Teasers, and Explanations

The most important fields, in order of their importance, are:

1. Image title and sub title - whose personality the image represents
2. Image teaser text on gallery page - why the visitor should see the larger version of it
3. The "Explain the [color]" buttons - explain the most prevalent colors in the image

### Use of Pronouns

These fields are "objective" and **must NOT use any first person (I, me, etc.) or second person (you, etc.) pronouns.**

Any third person pronouns (he, she, etc.) **must be unambiguous** with regards to whether they refer to the
person whose image is displayed or other individuals in the world at large.

## The Story is of "Medium" Importance

The stories can really help visitors understand the person, and hence the image.

The downside is that these:

- Are very personal and may require revealing information best kept private
- Can be difficult and time-consuming to write

Stories are personal so it is OK to use first person (I, me, etc.) and second person (you, etc.) pronouns.

### Stories and My Comfort Level

I am much more comfortable writing the stories for fictional characters and famous people.

**I am not very comfortable writing the stories for friends and family members.**

## The Least Important Fields: Link Buttons

The least important fields are:

- Link to the "Meat Portrait"
- "Compare To" Link
- "Contrast With" Link

# Conclusion

I fully understand that most people will not get the images, at least not at first.

I fully understand that some people will, after a while, understand the images.
The idea is really quite simple.

I fully understand that some people will refuse to open themselves to this idea.
My response to these people is the following series of articles on https://medium.com/@seeourminds

Thank you very much for your kind and open-minded attention to all this, my *magnum opus!*
