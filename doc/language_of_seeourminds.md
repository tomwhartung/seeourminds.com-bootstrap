The spiritual portraits on SeeOurMinds.com implement a very simple language.

# The SeeOurMinds.com Language

The SeeOurMinds.com language consists of the following six terms:

## Blue: Perception of Ideas

The color Blue represents iNtuition: a preference for perceiving ideas rather than facts.

### Types With the Most Blue: xNxP

The following types have the most Blue in their images:

- ENTP and INTP
- ENFP and INFP

### Why Blue?

- Opposite of Yellow
- Perception implies openness, and very dark colors are more open
- Compared to the other colors, Blue feels like it is moving away (receeding)
- Ideas tend to come to us during the night
- We tend to reflect on things during the night
  - Night is when our conscience may hit us, and we may regret our actions
  - When we think of cruel people, we may think: "How do they sleep at night?"

## Yellow: Perception of Facts

The color Yellow represents Sensation: a preference for perceiving facts rather than ideas.

### Types With the Most Yellow: xSxP

The following types have the most Yellow in their images:

- ESTP and ISTP
- ESFP and ISFP

### Why Yellow?

- Opposite of Blue
- Perception implies openness, and very light colors are more open
- Compared to the other colors, Yellow feels like it is coming forward
- Facts tend to come to us during the day
- We tend to work with things during the day
  - Yellow is associated with the sun and daytime
  - It's difficult to sleep in the day so we are more active

## Green: Decisions Made Logically

The color Green represents Thinking: a preference for making objective, logical decisions.

### Types With the Most Green: xxTJ

The following types have the most Red in their images:

- ENTJ and INTJ
- ESTJ and ISTJ

### Why Green?

- Opposite of Red
- Compared to Blue and Yellow, Green is stationary and closed: strong, unwavering
- Logic - universal, cool, unemotional
  - Law of the jungle: survival of the fittest
  - No feelings, no mercy, kill or be killed

## Red: Decisions Made Emotionally

The color Red represents Feeling: a preference for making personal, emotional decisions.

### Types With the Most Red: xxFJ

The following types have the most Red in their images:

- ENFJ and INFJ
- ESFJ and ISFJ

### Why Red?

- Opposite of Green
- Compared to Blue and Yellow, Red is closed and stationary: strong, unwavering
- Emotion - human, blood
  - Very personal, loving caring: hearts are Red, not Green
  - Getting mad and seeing Red

## Vertical:

Represents the person's most obvious function (color), and is directed outwardly.

- In Extraverts, this is the strongest (dominant) function.
- In Introverts, this is the supporting (auxiliary) function.

In personalities with **strong** preferences, the Vertical can get "lost" due to the image containing a plethora of just the one color.

## Horizontal:

Represents the person's function supporting their most obvious function (color), and is directed inwardly.

- In Extraverts, this is the supporting (auxiliary) function.
- In Introverts, this is the strongest (dominant) function.

In personalities with **extremely strong** preferences, the Horizontal can be very minimal, but it's still there!

# Misunderstandings and Conflicts

## Differing Perceptions Cause Misunderstandings

The Perceiving functions - iNtuition-idealism-Blue and Sensation-pragmatism-Yellow - cause the most difference between people.

- Idealistic people seem to be from a different planet than pragmatic types.

## Differences in Judging Cause Conflicts

The Judging functions - Thinking-logical-Green and Feeling-emotional-Red - cause the most conflicts between people.

- Both logical and emotional people are convinced that they are right and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

# How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Spiritual Portraits based on a score (percentages) rather than just a four-letter type show the
relative strengths of the preferences.
