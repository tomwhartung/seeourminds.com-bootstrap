The spiritual portraits on SeeOurMinds.com implement a very simple language.

# Basis of the Language

Most of these ideas come from or were inspired by the book [Concerning the Spiritual in Art, by Wassily Kandinsky](https://archive.org/details/onspiritualinart00kand).

# The SeeOurMinds.com Language

The SeeOurMinds.com language consists of the following six terms:

- Blue: Perception of Ideas
- Yellow: Perception of Facts
- Green: Decisions Made Logically
- Red: Decisions Made Emotionally
- Vertical: The Dominant Personality Function
- Horizontal: The Auziliary Personality Function

The text below describes each of these terms a bit more thoroughly.

## Vertical: The Dominant Personality Function

Represents the person's **most obvious** function (color), and is directed outwardly.

- In Extraverts, this is the strongest (dominant) function.
- In Introverts, this is the supporting (auxiliary) function.

In personalities with **extremely strong** preferences, the Vertical can get "lost" due to the image containing a plethora of just the one color.

## Horizontal: The Auziliary Personality Function

Represents the function **supporting** the person's most obvious function (color), and is directed inwardly.

- In Extraverts, this is the supporting (auxiliary) function.
- In Introverts, this is the strongest (dominant) function.

In personalities with **extremely strong** preferences, the Horizontal can be very minimal, but it's still there!

# Conclusion

Differing Perceptions can cause misunderstandings and differences in Judging preferences can cause conflicts.
