## Misunderstandings and Conflicts

### Differing Perceptions Cause Misunderstandings

The Perceiving functions - iNtuition-idealism-Blue and Sensation-pragmatism-Yellow - cause the most difference between people.

- Idealistic people seem to be from a different planet than pragmatic types.

### Differences in Judging Cause Conflicts

The Judging functions - Thinking-logical-Green and Feeling-emotional-Red - cause the most conflicts between people.

- Both logical and emotional people are convinced that they are right and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

### How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Comparing your spiritual portrait with others' images can help you quickly learn who is really looking at the world
and making decisions the the same way you do, and who has different preferences.

## Projection

We tend to want to get along with one another.

We tend to think others are like us.

When someone acts or sees things differently than we expect, it can cause misunderstandings and even conflicts.

### How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Comparing your spiritual portrait with others' images can help you quickly learn who is really looking at the world
and making decisions the the same way you do, and who has different preferences.

## We All Need Strong Auxiliary Functions

In the book Gifts Differing by Isabel Briggs Myers and Peter B. Myers, the authors break down why each type
needs a strong auxiliary function to support the dominant function.

I have no desire to repeat any of that here, but it should be obvious that:

- If someone's dominant function is making decisions without an auxiliary function gathering data, the decisions will be uninformed
- If someone's dominant function is gathering data without an auxiliary function making decisions, nothing will be getting accomplished

For more information, find a copy of the book at amazon.com or your local library.

### How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Spiritual Portraits based on a score (percentages) rather than just a four-letter type show the
relative strengths of the preferences.
