This file hightlights some of the benefits offered by spiritual portraits to those who are open-minded enough to embrace them.

# Dependencies

The benefits one can receive from having spiritual portraits of themself and their friends depends on these factors:

- Who they are
- Who their friends are
- The context of their relationship (work, family, social, etc.)

## Who Will Benefit the Most

These spiritual portraits are not going to appeal to everyone.
After all it is difficult to sell hambuger to a vegetarian and tofu to a steak-lover.

In general:

- This idea will appeal to people who are more iNtuitive than to Sensing types, because the whole idea is based on abstractions
- Likewise it will appeal to people who are more Feeling than to Thinking types, because the whole idea is about people

# Insights

Learning about a person's preferences, and the relative strength of each, offers
many insights to the person's personality and ultimately their behavior.

# Misunderstandings and Conflicts

### Differing Perceptions Cause Misunderstandings

The Perceiving functions - iNtuition-idealism-Blue and Sensation-pragmatism-Yellow - cause the most difference between people.

- Idealistic people seem to be from a different planet than pragmatic types.

## Differences in Judging Cause Conflicts

The Judging functions - Thinking-logical-Green and Feeling-emotional-Red - cause the most conflicts between people.

- Both logical and emotional people are convinced that they are right and anyone who disagrees is wrong.

## How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Comparing your spiritual portrait with others' images can help you quickly learn who is really looking at the world
and making decisions the the same way you do, and who has different preferences.

# Projection

We tend to want to get along with one another.

We tend to think others are like us.

When someone acts or sees things differently than we expect, it can cause misunderstandings and even conflicts.

Despite my best efforts, I fall into this trap more frequently than I care to admit.

Comparing your spiritual portrait with others' images can help you quickly learn who is really looking at the world
and making decisions the the same way you do, and who has different preferences.

# Strong Auxiliary Functions Are Important

In the book Gifts Differing by Isabel Briggs Myers and Peter B. Myers, the authors break down why each type
needs a strong auxiliary function to support the dominant function.

I have no desire to repeat any of that here, but it should be obvious that:

- If someone's dominant function is making decisions without an auxiliary function gathering data, the decisions will be uninformed
- If someone's dominant function is gathering data without an auxiliary function making decisions, nothing will be getting accomplished

For more information, find a copy of the book at amazon.com or your local library.

## How Spiritual Portraits Can Help

Spiritual Portraits based on a score (percentages) rather than just a four-letter type show the
relative strengths of the preferences.
