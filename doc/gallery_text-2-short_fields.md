All short text fields are important.

The buttons at the bottom of the page should appear (have values) only when appropriate.

# Guidelines for Short Text Fields

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

For consistency with other portraits, all short text fields should be populated with values consistent with the other galleries.

The buttons on the image page are less important, and should be populated only if appropriate values are easily obtainable.

# Specific Fields

For friends and family, I fill in most or all short descriptions,
but **if you don't like what I put there or it is wrong, let me know.**

## Gallery Page and Image Page

- `title` Image Title, i.e., Person's Name - text only (no html)
- `subtitle_html` Image Sub-title - may contain html (e.g., a link)

## Gallery Page Only

- `gallery_page_teaser` [Gallery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEl7devfqdc) Page Teaser - text only (no html)

## Image Page Only: Short Text Fields

These are the **most important** values.

- `explain_dom` Explain Dominant Color/Function, some is boilerplate - text only (no html)
- `explain_aux` Explain Auxiliary Color/Function, some is boilerplate - text only (no html)

Note that these `explain_*` short text fields should **not** contain any first (I, etc.) or second (you, etc.) person pronouns.

## Image Page Only - Buttons (Links)

These are the **least important** values.

- `meat_portrait_href` activates the "Show the Meat Portrait" button - link to photo
  - Rather than use this button, it's ok to embed a photo in the story
- `compare_to` activates the "Compare To" link at the bottom of the page
- `contrast_with` activates the "Contrast With" link at the bottom of the page
