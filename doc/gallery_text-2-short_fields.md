Short text fields are important.

# Guidelines for Short Text Fields

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

# Specific Fields

I will fill in most or all short descriptions, but **if you don't like what I put there or it is wrong, let me know.**

## Gallery Page and Image Page

- `title` Image Title, i.e., Person's Name - text only (no html)
- `subtitle_html` Image Sub-title - may contain html (e.g., a link)

## Gallery Page Only

- `gallery_page_teaser` Gallery Page Teaser - text only (no html)

## Short Text Fields - Image Page Only

- `explain_dom` Explain Dominant Color/Function - text only (no html)
- `explain_aux` Explain Auxiliary Color/Function - text only (no html)

Note that these `explain_*` short text fields should **not** contain any first (I, etc.) or second (you, etc.) person pronouns.

## Buttons (Links) - Image Page Only

These are the least important values.

- `meat_portrait_href` activates the "Show the Meat Portrait" button - link to photo
  - Rather than use this button, it's ok to embed a photo in the story
- `compare_to` activates the "Compare To" link at the bottom of the page
- `contrast_with` activates the "Contrast With" link at the bottom of the page
