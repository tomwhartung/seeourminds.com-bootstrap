People seem to assume that my goal in creating this site is to make money.

The purpose of this short document is to set the record straight.

# The Goals of Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com

Following is a list of my goals for creating Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com .

These goals are listed in the order of their priority, and goals that have been achieved - albeit temporarily, mind you - are checked off.

- [x] 1. Gain experience working with new technology
- [x] 2. Express my vision of how I look at the world in general and the people in it in particular
- [x] 3. Share this visualization technique to help myself and others learn about people, with the hope we can all have more harmonious relationships
- [ ] 4. Make [money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kjgwjh4H7wg) from this idea
- [ ] 5. Establish a unique brand and be recognized for contributing a unique way of looking at the world
- [ ] 6. Move [Kandinsky's triangle](https://medium.com/@tomwhartung/concerning-kandinskys-concerning-the-spiritual-in-art-f2f3d1ca750e)

Having achieved (temporarily, anyway) the first three goals, I am actively working on the fourth, by serving ads on [seeourminds.com](https://seeourminds.com) and personalized portraits on [groja.com](https://groja.com).

I feel it is important for others to realize that, although it is the goal I am currently working towards,
it is not one of the primary goals of the project.

# Hopefully...

Hopefully this makes things perfectly clear for anyone who is interested.
