People seem to assume that my goal in creating this site is to make money.

The purpose of this file is to set the record straight.

# The Goals of Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com

Following is a list of my goals for creating Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com .

These goals are listed in the order of their priority, and goals that have been achieved - albeit temporarily, mind you - are checked off.

- [x] 1. Gain experience working with new technology
- [x] 2. Express my vision of how I look at the world in general and the people in it in particular
- [-] 3. Share this visualization technique to help myself and others learn about people, with the hope we can all have more harmonious relationships
- [ ] 4. Make money
- [ ] 5. Establish my unique brand and ultimately become "famous" for contributing a unique way of looking at the world
- [ ] 6. Move Kandinsky's triangle

Hopefully this makes things perfectly clear for anyone who is interested.
