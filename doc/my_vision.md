# My Idealism

Life is not a heirarchy.
Society is not a pyramid.
People who are good at one thing, suck at other things.

Society is more like a jigsaw puzzle.
All people are roughly equivalent, just different shapes and colors.

# Looking Past the Surface

- People tend to appreciate this
- What someone says and How they act is more important to me than how they look
- Our bodies are restrictive, confining, a jail (Lose This Skin)

# Sick of This and That

Sick of ["racism,"](http://www.recordnet.com/article/20130105/A_OPINION0623/301050313) sexism, ageism, and all the rest.

- We should all be better than that by now
- Being aware of types may cause some to build prejudices against them.
  - I think this is already going on, on a sub-conscious level
  - Greater awareness can help make any bias work for rather than against us and our ideals

# Harmonious Relationships

- I like to get along with people
- Not everyone values this
- Sometimes being open to others gives them the impression they can take advantage
- Sometimes the only way to have a better relationship is to have no relationship
- I'd like to know in advance when I'm dealing with someone who will not be reciprocating my friendship, to avoid having to find that out the hard way
