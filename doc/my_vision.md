For the answer to this question, continue reading.

# Songs

Maybe include these as Easter Eggs - links to youtube videos.

# My Idealism

Life is not a heirarchy.
Society is not a pyramid.
People who are good at one thing, suck at other things.

Society is more like a jigsaw puzzle.
All people are roughly equivalent, just different shapes and colors.

# Looking Past the Surface

- People tend to appreciate this
- What someone says and How they act is more important to me than how they look
- Our bodies are restrictive, confining, a jail (Lose This Skin)
- I for one believe those who seek out plastic surgery would be better off investing in learning yoga and meditation
- Proof of the importance of promoting this way of looking at things is evident in the extreme behavior of beautiful women who
make themselves ill (anorexia and bulemia), destroying their inner beauty, in an effort to be more superficially beautiful

# Sick of All the *Isms

Sick of ["racism,"](http://www.recordnet.com/article/20130105/A_OPINION0623/301050313) sexism, ageism, and all the rest.

- We should all be better than that by now
- Being aware of types may cause some to build prejudices against them.
  - I think this is already going on, on a sub-conscious level
  - Greater awareness can help make any bias work for rather than against us and our ideals

Decisions made on the basis of external qualities are bound to be erroneous at best, and at worst become self-fulfilling prophecies.

# Harmonious Relationships

- I like to get along with people
- Not everyone values this
- Sometimes being open to others gives them the impression they can take advantage
- Sometimes the only way to have a better relationship is to have no relationship
- I'd like to know in advance when I'm dealing with someone who will not be reciprocating my friendship, to avoid having to find that out the hard way
