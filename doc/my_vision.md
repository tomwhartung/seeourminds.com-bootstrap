# Sick of This and That

Sick of racism, sexism, ageism, and all the rest.

- We should all be better than that by now
- Being aware of types may cause some to build prejudices against them.

# Looking Past the Surface

# Harmonious Relationships

- I like to get along with people
- Not everyone values this
- Sometimes being open to others gives them the impression they can take advantage
- Sometimes the only way to have a better relationship is to have no relationship
- I'd like to know in advance when I'm dealing with someone who will not be reciprocating my friendship, to avoid having to find that out the hard way
