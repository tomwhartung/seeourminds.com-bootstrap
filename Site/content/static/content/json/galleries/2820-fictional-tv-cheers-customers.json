  "story_html": "<p>While re-watching the series, I distinctly remember seeing Norm and Lilith have a conversation and thinking, <q>Lilith and Norm are opposites!</q>  Now, having performed a formal analysis of their personalities and drawn the images, it is gratifying to see how extreme their differences are.</p><p>Unfortunately Cliff's portrait does not show what an annoying weirdo he is.  An episode in which Frazier meets Cliff's mom Esther, and comments that Cliff suddenly seemed <q>almost heroically</q> well-adjusted, is quite revealing, but the image does not capture that.</p><p>The similarites between Frasier and Diane were obvious from the start.  It's almost as if the show's creators, producers, and writers knew she would be leaving the show, and brought him in to replace her, to provide the same sort of psychological tension.</p><p>And finally, Lilith is indeed quite a singular character.  Viewers gain insight into how she got that way in the episode <q><a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539859/' title='Link to the page for the episode Smotherly Love on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Smotherly Love</a>,</q> when Lilith's mom Betty pays her a visit.  Notably, Betty is one of the few characters able to insult Carla and leave her speechless, totally without a comback!</p><p>It took a long time to watch all 271 episodes of the series and create these images, but I am pleased with the results.
