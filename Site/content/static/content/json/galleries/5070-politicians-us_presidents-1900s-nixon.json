Even though Nixon was born two years <em>after </em> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Ronald Reagan' target='_blank'>Ronald Reagan</a>, he became president over a decade <em>before</em> Reagan.</p><p>As the large amounts of Green in their spiritual portraits show, Presidents Nixon and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5074/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Ronald Regan on this site'>Regan</a> had similar personalities.  And as the other colors show &mdash; Nixon's Yellow as opposed to Reagan's Blue in particular &mdash; there were differences.</p><h4>From Anti-Communist Congressman to Eisenhower's VP</h4><p>After serving in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy' title='Wikipedia page for the Navy' target='_blank'>Navy</a> during <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a>, Richard Nixon was caught up in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare' title='Wikipedia page for the Red Scare' target='_blank'>anti-communist fervor</a> that prevailed in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.</p><p>Nixon was a member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee' title='Wikipedia page for House Un-American Activities Committee' target='_blank'>House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) and earned the moniker <q>Tricky Dick</q> for his aggressively anti-Communist campaign tactics in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_California,_1950#Debut_of_the_Pink_Sheet' title='Wikipedia page for United States Senate election in California in 1950, cued to the section about the Debut of the Pink Sheet' target='_blank'>Senate election in California in 1950</a>.  His anti-communist stance, plus his young age and political base in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California' title='Wikipedia page for California' target='_blank'>California</a>, helped influence Eisenhower to choose Nixon as his running mate in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1952' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1952' target='_blank'>1952 Presidential election</a>.</p><p>Richard Nixon served two terms as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for Vice President' target='_blank'>Vice President</a> for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower' title='Wikipedia page for Dwight D. Eisenhower' target='_blank'>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, from 1953 to 1961.  Entering office as the 36th Vice President at the age of 40, Nixon was the second-youngest person to hold that office, the youngest being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Breckinridge' title='Wikipedia page for John C. Breckinridge' target='_blank'>John C. Breckinridge</a>, who took the office at age 36.</p><h4>From Loser to Law-and-Order Candidate</h4><p>Richard Nixon lost the very close presidential <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1960' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1960' target='_blank'>election in 1960</a> to <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5058/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John Fitzgerald Kennedy on this site'>John Fitzgerald Kennedy</a>, and lost again to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Brown' title='Wikipedia page for Pat Brown' target='_blank'>Pat Brown</a> when he ran for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gubernatorial_election,_1962' title='Wikipedia page for the California gubernatorial election in 1962' target='_blank'>governor of California</a> in 1962, and subsequently <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_November_1962_press_conference' title='Wikipedia page for Nixons so-called last press conference' target='_blank'>announced</a> he was leaving politics.</p><blockquote>I leave you gentleman now. You will now write it; you will interpret it; that's your right. But as I leave you I want you to know &mdash; just think how much you're going to be missing. You don't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Richard Nixon, in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RMSb-tS_OM' title='Video of the press conference on youtube.com' target='_blank'>press conference</a> given after losing the election for Governor of California, November 7, 1962.</blockquote><p>Nixon tried leaving politics and joined a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudge_Rose_Guthrie_Alexander_%26_Ferdon' title='Wikipedia page for the Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Ferdon law firm in New York City' target='_blank'>law firm</a> in New York City.  But politics was in his blood and he continued campaigning for Republican Party candidates in the 1964 and 1966 elections.</p><p>Richard Nixon returned to politics and ran for President again in 1968.  The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War' title='Wikipedia page for anti-Vietnam War demonstrations' target='_blank'>anti-Vietnam War demonstrations</a> were at their height, and as his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Ronald Reagan would do when running for re-election as Governor of California in 1970, Nixon leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate.</p><h4>Peacemaker</h4><p>Nixon won the fairly close, three-way <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1968' target='_blank'>presidential election in 1968</a>.  It's important to realize his anti-communist, law-and-order stance does not imply he was an enemy of peace.  It may surprise <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson#Fear_and_Loathing_on_the_Campaign_Trail_72' title='Wikipedia page for Hunter S. Thompson, cued to the section about Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail 72' target='_blank'>some people</a> but his goal, in fact, was for history to consider him a peacemaker.</p><p>As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, Richard Nixon preferred logic to emotion.  So although both he and the protesters wanted peace, he differed from them in that he was not inclined to get all emotional about it.</p><blockquote>What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.  The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Richard Nixon in his <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon#First_Inaugural_Address_(1969)' title='Link to quotes from his First Inaugural Address at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>First Inaugural Address</a>, January 20, 1969.</blockquote><p>In the <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3702' title='Link to the full text of his Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency speech at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency</a> speech he gave on November 7, 1972, Nixon would clarify this somewhat, saying it is important to work for <q>peace with honor.</q></p><h4>Crisis: Watergate</h4><p>When Richard Nixon ran for re-election in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972' title='Wikipedia page for the Presidential election of 1972' target='_blank'>Presidential election of 1972</a>, he won by a landslide.  Garnering over 60% of the popular vote, he carried all but one state.</p><p>Like many other two-term presidents, Nixon fell prey to the <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-term_curse' title='Wikipedia page for the alleged curse on the second term of presidents' target='_blank'>second-term curse</a></q> &mdash; a superstition that may betray the all-too-human tendency towards <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias' title='Wikipedia page for confirmation bias' target='_blank'>confirmation bias</a>.  In Nixon's case, the curse actually <q>came true.</q></p><p>Shortly after the start of Richard Nixon's second term, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Watergate scandal' target='_blank'>Watergate scandal</a> broke.  Unbeknownst to Nixon, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Plumbers' title='Wikipedia page for the White House Plumbers' target='_blank'>people in his administration</a> were committing criminal acts, including breaking into the offices of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg#Fielding_break-in' title='Wikipedia page for Daniel_Ellsberg, cued to the section about the break-in of the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding' target='_blank'>Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee' title='Wikipedia page for the Democratic National Committee' target='_blank'>Democratic National Committee</a>.</p><p>As the Yellow in Richard Nixon's spiritual portrait shows, he is more pragmatic than idealistic.  In this case, his pragmatic reaction when he learned about these break-ins ultimately caused his downfall.</p><h4>When Pragmatism Goes Wrong</h4><p>Rather than do the right thing and come clean, when Richard Nixon first learned about these crimes, he tried to cover them up.  But <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat_(Watergate)' title='Wikipedia page for the whistle-blower known as Deep Throat' target='_blank'>one thing</a> led to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre' title='Wikipedia page for the Saturday Night Massacre' target='_blank'>another</a>, and he found himself caught in his own web of deceit.</p><p>In Nixon's mind &mdash; at least initially &mdash; both Republicans and Democrats were guilty of <q>shady tactics,</q> and he was simply doing the <q>right</q> thing by supporting the people who worked for him.</p><blockquote>I know that it can be very easy, under the intensive pressures of a campaign, for even well-intentioned people to fall into shady tactics &mdash; to rationalize this on the grounds that what is at stake is of such importance to the Nation that the end justifies the means. And both of our great parties have been guilty of such tactics in the past.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3824' title='Link to the text of his Address to the Nation About the Watergate Investigations at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation About the Watergate Investigations</a>, April 30, 1973.</blockquote><p>In Nixon's mind, <q>the ends justifies the means</q> and &mdash; as he would later <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nixon_Interviews' title='Wikipedia page for The Nixon Interviews' target='_blank'>tell David Frost</a> &mdash; <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiHN3IJ_j8A' title='Extremely short video of Nixon saying this on youtube.com' target='_blank'>when the President does it, that means that it is <em>not</em> illegal.</a></q><h4><q>Not a Crook</q></h4><p>Although Richard Nixon did not participate in or even know about these specific criminal activities until after the fact, his actions led to Watergate Special Counsel <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Cox' title='Wikipedia page for Archibald Cox' target='_blank'>Archibald Cox</a> subpeonaing tape recordings from the White House, in an effort to find out who was guilty.</p><p>Faced with rapidly declining popularity, Nixon addressed the nation with his infamous claim, <q>I'm not a crook:</q></p><blockquote>I want to say this to the television audience. I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never profited from public service. I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. And I think, too, that I can say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh163n1lJ4M' title='Video of an excerpt from the televised address Nixon gave on youtube.com' target='_blank'>televised address</a> to the people of the United States, broadcast on <a href='https://www.npr.org/' title='Link to the home page of the web site for National Public Radio at www.npr.org' target='_blank'>National Public Radio</a>, November 17, 1973.</blockquote><p>Although Richard Nixon was willing to use politically <q>shady</q> tactics, he was not totally bereft of morality.  His pragmatism in helping to cover up the criminal acts may have caused his downfall, but he did his best to maintain some sense of personal honor.</p><h4>Ending the War in Vietnam</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Doctrine' title='Wikipedia page for the Nixon Doctrine' target='_blank'>Nixon Doctrine</a> the President set forth in 1969, he called for <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamization' title='Wikipedia page for Vietnamization' target='_blank'>Vietnamization</a></q> of the region.  Nixon hoped that by using troops from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam' title='Wikipedia page for Army of the Republic of Vietnam' target='_blank'>South Vietnamese Army</a> (ARVN) he could end <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_the_United_States_in_the_Vietnam_War' title='Wikipedia page for Americas involvement in the war in Vietnam' target='_blank'>America's involvement</a> in the region.</p><p>In both of his terms as president, Richard Nixon worked with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger' title='Wikipedia page for Henry Kissinger' target='_blank'>Henry Kissinger</a>, his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for National Security Advisor' target='_blank'>National Security Advisor</a>, on a number of fronts to end America's involvement in the Vietnam War.

Determined to be a peacemaker, the tenacious, decisive Nixon refused to give up.</p><p>In a speech Nixon gave upon being reelected in 1972, he uses the word <q>peace</q> six times in a single sentence:</p><blockquote>We are united Americans &mdash; North, East, West, and South, both parties &mdash; in our desire for peace, <b>peace with honor</b>, the kind of a peace that will last, and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal, not just in Vietnam, but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and between the world's most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, and the United States, are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace, true peace for the whole world, that man has ever known.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3702' title='Link to the full text of Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency</a>, November 7, 1972.  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote><h4>Nixon's Logic and Pragmatism</h4><p>A president who calls for peace while ordering the Air Force to run bombing missions may seem <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Enigmatic' title='Page for the term enigmatic at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>enigmatic</a>.  In calling for <q>peace with honor,</q> Richard Nixon makes it obvious he disagreed with <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-franklin-9301234' title='Link to Benjamin Franklin at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Benjamin Franklin</a>'s sentiment, expressed in a letter to his friend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Quincy_I' title='Wikipedia page for Josiah Quincy I' target='_blank'>Josiah Quincy</a> in 1783, that <q><a href='https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-40-02-0385' title='Link to the entire letter at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>there never was a good war, or a bad peace</a>.</q></p><p>Richard Nixon's preference for logic &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; along with his fervent anti-communism, would not let him agree to peace at any cost, despite the ongoing and intensifying emotional anti-war protests.  Doing so would be considered weakness and imply a willingness to allow South Vietnam to submit to North Vietnamese aggression.</p><p>And Nixon's preference for pragmatism &mdash; represented by the Yellow in his portrait &mdash; caused him to order increases in the bombings when attempts to help the opposing sides reach agreement stalled.  Bombs are facts that are impossible to ignore.</p><p>In one example of these pragmatic, destructive tactics, Nixon and Kissinger started seeing some <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords#Breakthrough_and_agreement' title='Wikipedia page for the Paris Peace Accords, cued to the section on Breakthrough and agreement' target='_blank'>breakthroughs</a> in the peace process in 1972, yet encountered resistance from the President of the South Vietnamese, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Thi%E1%BB%87u' title='Wikipedia page for Nguyễn Văn Thiệu' target='_blank'>Nguyễn Văn Thiệu</a>.  To demonstrate his continued support for the South Vietnamese, Nixon ordered <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Linebacker_II' title='Wikipedia page for Operation Linebacker II' target='_blank'>Operation Linebacker II</a>, known as the <q>Christmas Bombings,</q> in late December of 1972.</p><h4>Withdrawing the Troops</h4><p>Richard Nixon supplanted these military efforts with diplomatic efforts &mdash; in addition to the peace talks &mdash; by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks#SALT_I_Treaty' title='Wikipedia page for the Strategic_Arms_Limitation_Talks, cued to the section about the SALT I Treaty' target='_blank'>pursuing detente</a> with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonid_Brezhnev' title='Wikipedia page for Leonid Brezhnev' target='_blank'>Soviet</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_1972_visit_to_China' title='Wikipedia page for his visit to China in 1972' target='_blank'>Chinese</a> communist forces supporting the North Vietnamese.
