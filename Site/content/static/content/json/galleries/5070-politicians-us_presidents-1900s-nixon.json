In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this preference in the Nixon Doctrine, which assured allies the US would honor its treaties and provide a nuclear shield, while addressing both waning support for the Vietnam War in the US and budget concerns about similar costly endeavors in other countries.",
      "explain_aux": "The Yellow in Richard Nixon's spiritual portrait represents his auxiliary personality trait, his fairly strong preference for seeing a world of facts rather than ideas.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this preference in the way he adopted a more realistic, pragmatic view of the war in Vietnam than many of his predecessors did.",

And as the other colors show &mdash; Nixon's Yellow and Reagan's Blue in particular &mdash; they were quite different in others.</p><h4>Anti-Communist &mdash; and Peacemaker</h4><p>After serving in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy' title='Wikipedia page for the Navy' target='_blank'>Navy</a> during <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a>, Nixon was caught up in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare' title='Wikipedia page for the Red Scare' target='_blank'>anti-communist fervor</a> that prevailed in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  He was a member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee' title='Wikipedia page for House Un-American Activities Committee' target='_blank'>House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) and his anti-communist stance, plus his young age and political base in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California' title='Wikipedia page for California' target='_blank'>California</a>, influenced <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower' title='Wikipedia page for Dwight D.

Like his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Ronald Reagan, Nixon leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate.</p><p>His anti-communist, law-and-order stance does not imply that Nixon was an enemy of peace.  As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, he was logical &mdash; he certainly wanted peace, but unlike the protesters, did not think it wise to get all emotional about it.</p><blockquote>What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.
