In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this preference in the Nixon Doctrine, which assured allies the US would honor its treaties and provide a nuclear shield, while addressing both waning support for the Vietnam War in the US and budget concerns about similar costly endeavors in other countries.",

He demonstrated this preference in the way he adopted a more realistic, pragmatic view of the war in Vietnam than many of his predecessors did.",
      "story_intro_html": "<p>Born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorba_Linda,_California' title='Wikipedia page for Yorba Linda, California' target='_blank'>Yorba Linda, California</a> on January 9, 1913, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon' title='Wikipedia page for Richard Milhous Nixon' target='_blank'>Richard Milhous Nixon</a> became the 37th President at the age of 56 in 1969.  Even though Nixon was born two years <em>after </em> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Ronald Reagan' target='_blank'>Ronald Reagan</a>, he became president over a decade <em>before</em> Reagan.</p><h4>Eisenhower's VP, and Frustrated Candidate</h4><p>Before being elected President in 1968, Richard Nixon served two terms as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for Vice President' target='_blank'>Vice President</a> for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower' title='Wikipedia page for Dwight D. Eisenhower' target='_blank'>Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> from 1953 to 1961.  Entering office as the 36th Vice President at the age of 40, Nixon was the second-youngest person to hold that office, the youngest being <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Breckinridge' title='Wikipedia page for John C. Breckinridge' target='_blank'>John C. Breckinridge</a>, who took the office at age 36.</p><p>Nixon lost the very close <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1960' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1960' target='_blank'>presidential election in 1960</a>, and lost again when he ran for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gubernatorial_election,_1962' title='Wikipedia page for the California gubernatorial election in 1962' target='_blank'>governor of California</a> in 1962, and subsequently <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon%27s_November_1962_press_conference' title='Wikipedia page for Nixons so-called last press conference' target='_blank'>announced</a> he was leaving politics.</p><p>As the large amounts of Green in their spiritual portraits show, Presidents Nixon and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5074/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Ronald Regan on this site'>Regan</a> were similar in many ways.  And as the other colors show &mdash; Nixon's Yellow and Reagan's Blue in particular &mdash; they were a bit different in others.</p><h4>Anti-Communist, and Law-and-Order Candidate</h4><p>After serving in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy' title='Wikipedia page for the Navy' target='_blank'>Navy</a> during <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a>, Nixon was caught up in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare' title='Wikipedia page for the Red Scare' target='_blank'>anti-communist fervor</a> that prevailed in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  He was a member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee' title='Wikipedia page for House Un-American Activities Committee' target='_blank'>House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC) and his anti-communist stance, plus his young age and political base in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California' title='Wikipedia page for California' target='_blank'>California</a>, helped influence Eisenhower to choose Nixon as his running mate in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1952' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1952' target='_blank'>in 1952</a>.</p><p>In 1969, Richard Nixon was President during the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War' title='Wikipedia page for anti-Vietnam War demonstrations' target='_blank'>anti-Vietnam War demonstrations</a>.  Like his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Ronald Reagan, Nixon leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate.</p><h4>Peacemaker</h4><p>Richard Nixon's anti-communist, law-and-order stance does not imply he was an enemy of peace.</p><p>As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, Richard Nixon preferred logic to emotion.  So although both he and the protesters wanted peace, he simply differed from them in that he was not inclined to get all emotional about it.</p><blockquote>What kind of nation we will be, what kind of world we will live in, whether we shape the future in the image of our hopes, is ours to determine by our actions and our choices.  The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Richard Nixon in his <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon#First_Inaugural_Address_(1969)' title='Link to quotes from his First Inaugural Address at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>First Inaugural Address</a>, January 20, 1969.</blockquote><p>The sentence ending this quote &mdash; <q>The greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker</q> &mdash; has been memorialized as Nixon's <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=epitaph' title='Page for the term epitaph at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>epitaph</a>.</p><h4>Crisis: Watergate</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election of 1972' target='_blank'>presidential election of 1972</a>, Richard Nixon carried all but one state.  Like many two-term presidents, he fell prey to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-term_curse' title='Wikipedia page for the alleged curse on the second term of presidents' target='_blank'>second-term curse</a>, a superstition that may betray a tendency towards <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias' title='Wikipedia page for confirmation bias' target='_blank'>confirmation bias</a>, but proved to be very real in Nixon's case.</p><p>Shortly after the start of his second term, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Watergate scandal' target='_blank'>Watergate scandal</a> broke.  Unbeknownst to Nixon, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Plumbers' title='Wikipedia page for the White House Plumbers' target='_blank'>people in his administration</a> were committing criminal acts, including the breaking into the offices of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ellsberg#Fielding_break-in' title='Wikipedia page for Daniel_Ellsberg, cued to the section about the break-in of the office of his psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis Fielding' target='_blank'>Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee' title='Wikipedia page for the Democratic National Committee' target='_blank'>Democratic National Committee's</a>.</p><p>As the Yellow in Richard Nixon's spiritual portrait shows, he is more pragmatic than idealistic.  In this case, his pragmatism contributed to his downfall.</p><h4>When Pragmatism Goes Wrong</h4><p>Rather than do the right thing and come clean, when Richard Nixon first learned about these crimes, he tried to cover them up.  But <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat_(Watergate)' title='Wikipedia page for the whistle-blower known as Deep Throat' target='_blank'>one thing</a> led to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre' title='Wikipedia page for the Saturday Night Massacre' target='_blank'>another</a>, and he found himself caught in his own web of deceit.</p><p>In Nixon's mind &mdash; at least initially &mdash; both sides were guilty of <q>shady tactics,</q> and he was doing the right thing by standing by the people who worked for him.</p><blockquote>I know that it can be very easy, under the intensive pressures of a campaign, for even well-intentioned people to fall into shady tactics &mdash; to rationalize this on the grounds that what is at stake is of such importance to the Nation that the end justifies the means. And both of our great parties have been guilty of such tactics in the past.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3824' title='Link to the text of his Address to the Nation About the Watergate Investigations at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation About the Watergate Investigations</a>, April 30, 1973.</blockquote><h4><q>Not a Crook</q></h4><p>Although Nixon personally did not know about these specific activities until after the fact, his actions led to Watergate Special Counsel <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Cox' title='Wikipedia page for Archibald Cox' target='_blank'>Archibald Cox</a> subpeonaing tape recordings from the White House, in an effort to find out who was guilty.</p><p>Faced with rapidly declining popularity, Nixon addressed the nation with his infamous claim, <q>I'm not a crook:</q></p><blockquote>I want to say this to the television audience. I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never profited from public service. I have earned every cent. And in all of my years of public life, I have never obstructed justice. And I think, too, that I can say that in my years of public life, that I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned everything I've got.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh163n1lJ4M' title='Video of an excerpt from the televised address Nixon gave on youtube.com' target='_blank'>televised address</a> to the people of the United States, broadcast on <a href='https://www.npr.org/' title='Link to the home page of the web site for National Public Radio at www.npr.org' target='_blank'>National Public Radio</a>, November 17, 1973.</blockquote><p>Although Richard Nixon was willing to use politically <q>shady</q> tactics, he was not totally bereft of morality.  His pragmatism may have contributed to his downfall, but he did his best to maintain some sense of personal honor.</p> <h4>Ending the War in Vietnam</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Doctrine' title='Wikipedia page for the Nixon Doctrine' target='_blank'>Nixon Doctrine</a> the President set forth in 1969, he called for <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamization' title='Wikipedia page for Vietnamization' target='_blank'>Vietnamization</a></q> of the region.  Nixon hoped that by using troops from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam' title='Wikipedia page for Army of the Republic of Vietnam' target='_blank'>South Vietnamese Army</a> (ARVN) he could end <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_the_United_States_in_the_Vietnam_War' title='Wikipedia page for Americas involvement in the war in Vietnam' target='_blank'>America's involvement</a> in the region.</p><p>In both of his terms as president, Richard Nixon worked with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger' title='Wikipedia page for Henry Kissinger' target='_blank'>Henry Kissinger</a>, his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for National Security Advisor' target='_blank'>National Security Advisor</a>, on a number of fronts to end America's involvement in the Vietnam War.

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote> <h4>Nixon's Part: Logic and Facts</h4> <p>A president who calls for peace while ordering the Air Force to run bombing missions seems <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Enigmatic' title='Page for the term enigmatic at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>enigmatic</a>.  In calling for <q>peace with honor,</q> Richard Nixon makes it obvious he disagreed with <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-franklin-9301234' title='Link to Benjamin Franklin at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Benjamin Franklin</a>'s sentiment, expressed in a Letter to Josiah Quincy dated September 11, 1783, that <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/benjamin_franklin_108416' title='Link to this quote at www.brainyquote.com' target='_blank'>There never was a good war or a bad peace</a>.</q></p> <p>Agreeing to peace at any cost &mdash; certainly a temptation, given the ongoing and intensifying anti-war protests &mdash; was not possible, because it might imply a willingness to force South Vietnam to submit to North Vietnamese aggression.</p> <p>If Nixon was going to call for peace, it would be a peace on his terms &mdash; terms that would not compromise his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_patriotism' title='Wikipedia page for American patriotic ideals' target='_blank'>patriotic ideals</a> or pose any risks to any of the freedoms Americans had grown accustomed to over the nation's past 200+ years.</p> <p>As Nixon's attempts to help the opposing sides reach agreement stalled, he ordered increases in the bombings.</p> <p>Nixon's part in this was to:</p> <ul> <li>engage in peace talks </li> <li>drop bombs to help ensure a willingness to talk </li> </ul> <p></p> <blockquote></blockquote> <p></p> <h4></h4> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote></blockquote> <p></p> <h4>A Mixed Legacy</h4> <p>Ended the Vietnam War.</p> <p>On February 6, 1974 the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives' title='Wikipedia page for the House of Representatives' target='_blank'>House of Representatives</a> decided Nixon's role in covering up the malfeasance was enough for them to initiate <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_process_against_Richard_Nixon' title='Wikipedia page for the Impeachment process against Richard Nixon' target='_blank'>impeachment proceedings</a> against him.
