      "explain_dom": "The Green in Richard Nixon's spiritual portrait represents his dominant personality trait, his strong preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this preference in the Nixon Doctrine, which assured allies the US would honor its treaties and provide a nuclear shield, while addressing both waning support for the Vietnam War in the US and budget concerns about similar costly endeavors in other countries.",
      "explain_aux": "The Yellow in Richard Nixon's spiritual portrait represents his auxiliary personality trait, his fairly strong preference for seeing a world of facts rather than ideas.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this preference in the way he adopted a more realistic, pragmatic view of the war in Vietnam than many of his predecessors did.",
