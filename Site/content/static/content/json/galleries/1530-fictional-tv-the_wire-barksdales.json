  "description_html": "<p>These images show the personalities of Avon and Stringer are as different as night and day.  Both are decisive and keep their cards close to the vest, but Avon's warmth and pragmatism contrast strongly with Stringer's cool demeanor and his ability to recognize patterns and relationships in the chaos of Baltimore's urban crime environment.</p><p>If Stringer and Avon are the head and the heart of the Barksdale organization, soldiers like Wee Bey and Slim Charles are the arms and legs.  Their portraits show they are both open to direction and willing to carry out their orders with pragmatic, ruthless efficiency.</p>",
