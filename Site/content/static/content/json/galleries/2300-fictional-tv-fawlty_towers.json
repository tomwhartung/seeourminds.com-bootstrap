  "story_html": "<p>Filmed in front of a live audience, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawlty_Towers' title='Wikipedia page for Fawlty Towers' target='_blank'>Fawlty Towers</a> is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farce' title='Wikipedia page for farce' target='_blank'>farce</a> and full of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_comedy' title='Wikipedia page for physical humour' target='_blank'>physical humour</a>.  In commentary tracks on the DVD release Cleese frequently complains that some of the actors &mdash; particularly his wife Connie &mdash; did not hit him hard enough.  One of my favorite comments of his is that one of the characters should have shown <q>20% more anger.</q></p><p>Appearing at the very top of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/list/ls000151593/' title='Page for The BFI TV 100 (2000) on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The BFI TV 100 (2000)</a>, the show is a prime example of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_humour' title='Wikipedia page for British humour' target='_blank'>British humour</a>.  Based on my experience, that sort of humour is not for everyone.</p><p>These spiritual portraits show that the characters on the show are quite diverse.  Nothing would please me more than to learn these images inspired someone who believes they do not care for this type of humour to give it another chance.</p><p>You can find many of the episodes online on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/' title='Home page of youtube.com' target='_blank'>youtube</a>.  A few of the best ones are <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy15m_EiQ-A' title='Video of Gourmet Night episode on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Gourmet Night</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebaLEPYPjBs' title='Video of The Germans episode on youtube.com' target='_blank'>The Germans</a>, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi2IY5C9yDA' title='Video of The Kipper and the Corpse episode on youtube.com' target='_blank'>The Kipper and the Corpse</a>, and <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCzC-edhRdA' title='Video of Basil the Rat episode on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Basil the Rat</a>.</p><p>Moreover, if you give Fawlty Towers a chance and still do not care for British humour, you can say that at least you gave the best of their shows a chance.</p>",
