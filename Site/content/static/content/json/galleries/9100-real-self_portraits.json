Hartung</a>, the creator of this site!</p><p>These portraits may look a little bit different from each other, but all of them have the same overall <q>mood.</q>  This is because they all show a fairly strong preference for being idealism (iNtuition, represented by the Blue) over pragmatism (Sensation, represented by the Yellow).</p><p>The images here also all show relatively mild preferences for the Feeling-Thinking and the Judging-Perceiving pairs of opposites.  This balance makes all of the images fairly colorful, showing I am versatile and flexible.</p><p>These spiritual portraits also demonstrate how the Groja &copy; program can draw higher-resolution images that can be quite intricate, but still convey the same overall <q>mood.</q></p>",
  "story_html": "<p>My results on the Keirsey questionnaire show a very slight preference for Feeling (Red) over Thinking (Green).  My results on the Humanmetrics questionairre show the opposite: a very slight preference for Thinking (Green) over Feeling (Red).</p><p>My results on the Keirsey questionnaire show a very slight preference for Perceiving (increasing the amount Blue and Yellow) over Judging (increasing the amount of Green and Red).  My results on the Real MBTI &reg; questionairre show the opposite: a very slight preference for Judging (Green and Red) over Perceiving (Blue and Yellow).</p><p>An INFP with a stronger Feeling preference is <a href='/image/0500-real-famous/0500' title='Spiritual portrait of Woody Allen on this site' target='_blank'>Woody Allen</a>.  I find it fairly easy to relate to him, but defintely feel more logical (Woody did not like school, but I loved it).</p><p>An INTJ with a stronger Thinking preference is the fictional character from True Detective, <a href='/image/2310-fictional-tv-true_detective-1/2316' title='Spiritual portrait of Rust Cohle on this site' target='_blank'>Rust Cohle</a>.  I find it easier to relate to his character than to most cops, but definitely feel that he's much more extreme than I could ever be.</p><p>I feel strongly that my awareness of these differences &mdash; even these more subtle differences which are more of degree rather than just <q>type</q> &mdash; is very helpful in my day-to-day life.  I consider this site, and the vision it presents, to be my very own personal equivalent of <span class='air-quotes'><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85NLPB2wjQ' title='Video on youtube of Nicholas Cage as Sailor talking about his snakeskin jacket in an excerpt from Wild at Heart' target='_blank'>Sailor's snakeskin jacket</a>.</span></p><p>For more, see my article on medium.com about all this!</p>",
