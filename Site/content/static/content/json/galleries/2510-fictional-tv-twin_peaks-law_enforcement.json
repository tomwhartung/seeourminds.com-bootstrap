Agent Cooper and Sheriff Truman in particular may look at the world differently, but they share a preference for logic over emotion.</p><p>The team also works well together, with very little conflict.  The images show that Lucy can be just as much of a boss as Harry is, and it is natural for Hawk and Andy to cooperate with them.</p><p> </p>",
