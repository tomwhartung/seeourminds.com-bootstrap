If the topic interests you, check out David Keirsey's book about <a href='http://www.keirsey.com/pres_book.aspx' title='Link to Presidential Temperament on Keirsey.com' target='_blank'>Presidential Temperament</a>, which covers this topic in depth!</p><p>It can be tricky figuring out what the types are for these people.  For some of them, I consulted with one or more friends while going through the Temperament Sorter in David Keirsey's <a href='http://www.keirsey.com/pum_2.aspx' title='Link to Please Understand Me on keirsey.com' target='_blank'>Please Understand Me</a>, and for others I used the type from his book to construct a generic (58%/42%) image.</p>",
