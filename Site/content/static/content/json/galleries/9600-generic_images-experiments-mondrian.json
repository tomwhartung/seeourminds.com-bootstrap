And this is definitely not fair to those types for which the composition does not <q>work</q> as well.</p><p>Therefore I consider this to be a failed experiment, and the option to use this composition is not available in the current version of the program.</p>",
  "story_html": "<p>If you think about it, there can be any number of ways to represent a personality visually.  (Sometimes I wonder if I am the only person who thinks about these things!)</p><p>Naturally, some of these representations are going to work better than others.  And there's only one way to find out which ones will work and which won't &mdash; and that is to try them and see!</p><p>After getting the <a href='/gallery/9500-generic_images-original/' title='Link to the Sixteen Types Gallery on this site, which contains the Original Composition images' target='_blank'>Original Compositions</a> working in the third version of this program (using PHP Nuke), I decided to try a couple of ideas I had for different compositions.  These images, and those in the <a href='/gallery/9700-generic_images-experiments-rhythm/' title='Link to the experimental images in the Rhythm Composition Gallery'>Rhythm Composition Gallery</a>, are the results of those experiments.</p><p>Some of the images in this gallery do not look all that bad, but some are actually pretty horrible.  In my opinion, the images of the Introverts in particular are quite hideous!  (Note that these appear further down the page, due to the images being in alphabetical order by four-letter-type.)</p><p>Things like this often remind me of ballet class.  The dancer's job is to make their art look effortless, but anyone who has tried to do what they do can appreciate that it is extremely difficult!</p>",
