In fact, as is commonly the case, these psychological opposites fuel a strong attraction between the two.</p><p>It is interesting to see how, at least as far as this simple yet revealing analysis goes, the dynamic between Padme and Anakin's personalities is analogous to the dynamic that existed between <a href='/image/0500-real-famous-celebrities/0509/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt on this site'>Eleanor</a> and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Franklin Roosevelt on this site'>Franklin Roosevelt</a>.</p><h4>Padme's Passion</h4><p>The Red in Padme Amidala's spiritual portrait represents her passion.  Understanding that <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin</a> is a Jedi and hence forbidden to marry, at first she tries to keep quiet about her strong feelings of affection for him.</p><p>Padme finally breaks her silence when she and Anakin face imminent execution, and there is no longer any reason to keep quiet about these feelings:</p><blockquote>Anakin Skywalker: Don't be afraid.<br />Padme Amidala: I'm not afraid to die.  I've been dying a little bit each day since you came back into my life.<br />Anakin: What are you talking about?<br />Padme: I love you.<br />Anakin: You love me?  I thought that we had decided not to fall in love, that we would be forced to live a lie, and that it would destroy our lives.<br />Padme: I think our lives are about to be destroyed anyway.  I truly, deeply, love you, and before we die, I want you to know.  [They kiss.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.</blockquote><p>The couple miraculously survives this brush with death and &mdash; with Padme having finally revealed her true feelings &mdash; they secretly marry.</p><h4>Padme's Ideals</h4><p>The Blue in Padme's portrait represents her idealism.  She has made it obvious she embraces the democratic political ideals of the Republic, first as the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Monarch_of_Naboo' title='Link to a page about the Monarch of Naboo at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Queen of Naboo</a>, and then later as a senator.</p><p>Padme also embraces the ideal of a relationship with open communication &mdash; one in which both spouses are open and feel free to talk about whatever might be bothering them.</p><blockquote>Padme Amidala: What is it?<br />Anakin Skywalker: Nothing.<br />Padme: Don't do this.  Don't shut me out.  Let me help you.  Hold me.  Like you did by the lake on Naboo.  So long ago, when there was nothing but our love.  No politics, no plotting, no war.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote><p>Anakin is fortunate to have a woman like Padme to listen to and love him.  He can see this, of course, and it in turn makes him determined to do everything he can to preserve their relationship.</p><h4>Padme and Anakin, and Palpatine</h4><p>The <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> gives fans the background stories for characters in the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the Star Wars original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a>.

His preference for rational decisions, represented by the Green, is only slightly stronger than &mdash; and constantly at odds with &mdash; his preference for making emotional decisions.</p><p>While he and Padme <a href='http://www.starwars.com/news/galactic-backpacking-part-2-visiting-real-world-naboo' title='Link to a page on starwars.com describing the picnic scene' target='_blank'>frolic in a meadow</a> on Naboo, he tells her how he thinks the <q>system</q> is broken, but he's not quite sure how to fix it.  He is sure that <q>someone wise</q> should take over and somehow force people into agreement:</p><blockquote>Anakin Skywalker: I don't think the system works.<br />Padme Amidala: How would you have it work?<br />Anakin: We need a system where the politicians sit down and discuss the problem, agree what's in the best interest of all the people, and then do it.<br />Padme: That's exactly what we do.  The trouble is that people don't always agree.<br />Anakin: Well then they should be made to.<br />Padme: By whom?   Who's going to make them?<br />Anakin: I don't know.  Someone.<br />Padme: You?<br />Anakin: Of course not me.<br />Padme: But someone.<br />Anakin: Someone wise.<br />Padme: Sounds an awful lot like a dictatorship to me.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.</blockquote><p>It certainly does sound like Anakin is in favor of some sort of dictatorship.  It also sounds like their differences in opinion might grow more difficult to ignore as their relationship progresses.</p><h4>Emotional Exploitation</h4><p>As Anakin Skywalker progresses in his Jedi training, his powerful emotions &mdash; his lingering anger over the death of his Mother and now his intense love for Padme &mdash; are constantly at odds with his desire to be a calm, rational Jedi.  Anakin's situation brings to mind the conflict Thomas Jefferson felt between <a href='http://www.pbs.org/jefferson/archives/documents/frame_ih195811.htm' title='Copy of the My Head and My Heart letter at in the archives at pbs.org' target='_blank'>his head and his heart</a> when he met the enchanting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway' title='Wikipedia page for Maria Cosway' target='_blank'>Maria Cosway</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1226/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine on this site'>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine</a> exploits Anakin's emotions &mdash; especially his fear of losing Padme &mdash; in the Chancellor's insidious quest for <q>unlimited power:</q></p><blockquote>Supreme Chancellor Palpatine: Learn to know the dark side of the Force, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.<br />Anakin Skywalker: What did you say?<br />Palpatine: Use my knowledge.  I beg you.<br />Anakin: [Activates his light sabre.] You're the Sith lord.<br />Palpatine: I know what's been troubling you.  Listen to me.  Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council.  Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi.  A life of significance, of conscience.  Are you going to kill me?<br />Anakin: I would certainly like to.<br />Palpatine: I know you would.  I can feel your anger.  It gives you focus, makes you stronger.<br />Anakin: [De-activates his light sabre.] I'm going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.<br />Palpatine: Of course.  You should.  But you're not sure of their intentions, are you?<br />Anakin: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.<br />Palpatine: You have great wisdom, Anakin.  Know the power of the dark side.

      "explain_dom": "The Yellow in this spiritual portrait represents Sheev Palpatine's dominant personality trait, his realism.  In Introverts, the dominant trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.  Palpatine demonstrates this trait in the way he forsakes all ideals in his quest for absolute and total power over everyone in the galaxy, focusing all of his attention on his single, ambitious goal.",
      "explain_aux": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Sheev Palpatine's auxiliary personality trait, his very strong preference for logic.  In Introverts, the auxiliary trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a vertical line to represent this, because it is more evident than the dominant function.  Palpatine demonstrates this trait in the way he shows no emotion, except perhaps a perverse gleefulness, when commanding that people, and even entire civilizations, be murdered.",

He is so logical, in fact, that he wants to be in charge of making decisions for everyone in the entire galaxy.</p><p>At one point Supreme Chancellor Palpatine gives <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin Skywalker</a> some insight into his take on the difference between good and evil:</p><blockquote>Good is a point of view, Anakin.
