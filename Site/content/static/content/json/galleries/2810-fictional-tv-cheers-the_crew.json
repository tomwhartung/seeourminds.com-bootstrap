  "description_html": "<p>The people who work at <a href='http://cheers.wikia.com/wiki/Cheers_Wiki' title='Link to the Home page at cheers.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Cheers</a> are mostly a friendly bunch &mdash; with Carla being the obvious exception.  This is visible in the spiritual portraits of the team: her image contrasts strongly with the images of the other team members' personalities.</p><p>The large amounts of Red and Green in Carla's image depict her decisiveness, while Yellow dominates the images of Coach, Woody, and Rebecca to varying degrees.  The Yellow and Blue in their images indicates they are more open to new experiences and ideas than Carla.</p>",
  "story_html": "<p>Clearly, Carla needs to be decisive because she is a single mom with eight children.  She needs to get things done and doesn't have any time for any sort of folderol, whatsoever.</p><p>Meanwhile, Coach, Woody, and Rebecca have a much easier time of it, because they are single and not caring for any children.  With Rebecca kind of, but not really, in charge, and the very experienced Sam there to pick up the slack, Coach and Woody only have to worry about making drinks.</p>",
