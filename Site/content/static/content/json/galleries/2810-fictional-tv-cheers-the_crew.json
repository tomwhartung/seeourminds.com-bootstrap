  "description_html": "<p>In these spiritual portraits of the team at <a href='http://cheers.wikia.com/wiki/Cheers_Wiki' title='Link to the Home page at cheers.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Cheers</a>, Carla's image contrasts strongly with the images of the other team members' personalities.</p><p>The large amounts of Red and Green in Carla's image depicts her decisiveness, while Yellow dominates the images of Coach, Woody, and Rebecca to varying degrees, indicating they are more open than Carla.</p>",
  "story_html": "<p>Clearly, Carla needs to be decisive because she is a single mom with eight children: she needs to get things done and doesn't have any time for any sort of folderol, whatsoever.</p><p>Meanwhile, because they are single, Coach, Woody, and Rebecca have a much easier time of it.  With Rebecca kind of but not really in charge, and Sam there to pick up the slack, Coach and Woody are free to concern themselves only with making drinks.</p>",
