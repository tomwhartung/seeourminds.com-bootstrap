I appreciate your [Laura Poitras' and Glenn Greenwald's] concern for my safety, but I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk.</blockquote><p>As a firmly decisive and logical person, it's easy to see how he could feel he had no choice but to do what he did.  I can almost hear his conscience saying <span class='air-quotes'>They taught me one thing in school, now they're doing something else in real life!  Hellooooo!  This does not compute!</span></p><p>I have to admire his courage and idealism, but it's important to stress that I created this site to help people visualize personalities, <b>not</b> to convert people to one political ideology or another.</p><blockquote>So, for me, it all comes down to state power against the people's ability to meaningfully oppose that power.  And I'm sitting there, uh, every day getting paid to design methods to amplify that state power.</blockquote><p>As an idealist, I enjoy seeing idealism in others, and find it interesting to learn his four-letter-type matches that of the contemptuous <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2040/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Joffrey Baratheon on this site' target='_blank'>Joffrey Baratheon</a>.  In addition to being idealistic, he's obviously fearless, and after watching the movie I can't help but be glad he did what he did.</p><p>I wonder how he feels about his actions now that the dust has settled and he's living in exile.</p><blockquote>These are public issues, these are not my issues you know, these are everybody's issues.  I'm not afraid of you, you know.  You're not going to bully me into silence like you've done to everybody else.  And if nobody else is gonna do it, I will, and hopefully when I'm gone, whatever you do to me, there will be somebody else who'll do the same thing.</blockquote><p>It is important to realize that, because this personality profile is based only on the film Citizenfour, it may not be completely accurate.</p><p>Although he doesn't show it outwardly, it's obvious that Ed was under a great deal of stress during this time.  Therefore it may not accurately show who he is in his typical day-to-day life during less stressful times.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Ed Snowden, and perhaps support him with a donation, visit his site at <a href='https://www.edwardsnowden.com/' title='Home page of edwardsnowden.com' target='_blank'>edwardsnowden.com</a>.</p>",
