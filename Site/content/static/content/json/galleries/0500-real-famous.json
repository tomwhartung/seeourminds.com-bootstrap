      "story_html": "<p>While he was still in high school, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen' title='Wikipedia page for Woody Allen' target='_blank'>Woody Allen</a> started writing one-liners for established comedians.  This led to writing for and even appearing on TV shows such as the Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.</p><p>In the 1960s he started doing stand-up.  He hated it.</p><blockquote>I kept saying, <q>I'm not funny, I'm not a comic, you know, I can't do this, I hate it, I don't like the hours, I'm shy, you know I don't like standing in front of an audience.</q> I mean there was nothing about it I liked.  I kept saying <q>I want to quit, I want to quit.</q></blockquote><p>It sounds to me like he might be a bit Introverted.</p><p>Woody went on to be a playwright, and this led to filmmaking.  Writing a screenplay led to work as a director, and this led to him writing, directing, and starring in a series of successful films.</p><p>It turned out that like Hitchcock and Truffaut, Woody worked best as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur' title='Wikipedia page for auteur' target='_blank'>auteur</a>, someone who had complete control over all creative aspects of a film.  But making the shift from comedy to drama proved to be more difficult than expected.</p><blockquote>It's harder for me, and I embarrass myself more readily, but I get more pleasure out of failing in a project that I am enthused over, than in succeeding in a project that I know I can do well.</blockquote><p>A more pragmatic person would have more Yellow in their spiritual portrait &mdash; and probably more money in their bank account.  As an <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to the gallery page containing my self portraits on this site' target='_blank'>INFP myself</a>, I took my time with college, changing majors a few times and even quiting for awhile.</p><p>So I can certainly understand where he's coming from.  As The Beatles so aptly put it: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwxJUXPHvE' title='Youtube video for the song Cant Buy Me Love by The Beatles' target='_blank'>Can't Buy Me Love.</a></p><blockquote>I've been working on the quantity theory.  I feel if I keep making films and just keep making them, every once in awhile I'll get lucky and one will come out.  And that's exactly what happens.</blockquote><p>And that, dear reader, is exactly what's been going on with me and this <span class='air-quotes'>spiritual portrait</span> idea, which I am presenting on this site for the umpteenth time!</p><blockquote>There are a lot of surprises that happen between writing it, doing it, and seeing it on the screen.  Most surprises are negative.  Most surprises are, that you thought something was good or funny, and it's not....  Cause it's not easy.  If it was easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't be valuable....  There's a big difference between what you set out to make, and what you make, almost every time.</blockquote><p>Make no mistake: if this site is successful this time around, it will be in great part to the inspiration and ideas I've gotten from all of the more down-to-earth pragmatic people I've met over the past few years at the various <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' title='Home page for meetup.com' target='_blank'>meetups</a> around town.  Many of these friends will undoubtedly have more Yellow in their spiritual portraits, but like Woody I love what I do &mdash; and that's more important to people like us than the numbers in our bank accounts!</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the two-disk DVD boxed set, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895299/' title='Page on imdb.com for Woody Allen: A Documentary' target='_blank'>Woody Allen: A Documentary</a>.</p>",

I can almost hear his conscience saying <span class='air-quotes'>They taught me one thing in school, now they're doing something else in real life!  Hellooooo!  This does not compute!</span></p><p>I have to admire his courage and idealism, but it's important to stress that I created this site to help people visualize personalities, <b>not</b> to convert people to one political ideology or another.</p><blockquote>So, for me, it all comes down to state power against the people's ability to meaningfully oppose that power.  And I'm sitting there, uh, every day getting paid to design methods to amplify that state power.</blockquote><p>As an idealist, I enjoy seeing idealism in others, and find it interesting to learn his four-letter-type matches that of the contemptuous <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2040/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Joffrey Baratheon on this site' target='_blank'>Joffrey Baratheon</a>.  In addition to being idealistic, he's obviously fearless, and after watching the movie I can't help but be glad he did what he did.</p><p>I wonder how he feels about his actions now that the dust has settled and he's living in exile.</p><blockquote>These are public issues, these are not my issues you know, these are everybody's issues.  I'm not afraid of you, you know.  You're not going to bully me into silence like you've done to everybody else.  And if nobody else is gonna do it, I will, and hopefully when I'm gone, whatever you do to me, there will be somebody else who'll do the same thing.</blockquote><p>It is important to realize that, because this personality profile is based only on the film Citizenfour, it may not be completely accurate.</p><p>Although he doesn't show it outwardly, it's obvious that Ed was under a great deal of stress during this time.  Therefore it may not accurately show who he is in his typical day-to-day life during less stressful times.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Ed Snowden, and perhaps support him with a donation, visit his site at <a href='https://www.edwardsnowden.com/' title='Home page of edwardsnowden.com' target='_blank'>edwardsnowden.com</a>.</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based only on what I learned about Edward from watching <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Poitras' title='Wikipedia page for Laura Poitras' target='_blank'>Laura Poitras'</a> movie about him, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/' title='Imdb.com page for Citizenfour' target='_blank'>Citizenfour</a>.</p>",

It turns out that Imelda actually equates beauty with god and love:</p><blockquote>It is not expensive to be beautiful.  It takes only a little effort, to be presentable, and beautiful.  But, it takes some effort.  And E for effort.  And unfortunately, people think of beauty as luxury; of beauty as frivolity, no!  Or extravagant.  Beauty is a discipline.

And from her point of view this infatuation is based not on selfishness but on her concern for the poor, <q>little</q> people in her country.</p><blockquote>I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios, I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star. Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing housedresses and slippers. That's not what people want to see. People want someone they can love, someone to set an example.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Imelda_Marcos' title='Link to quote from The LA Times at wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>The LA Times</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>The movie about her life, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>, directed by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225035/' title='Page for Ramona S.
