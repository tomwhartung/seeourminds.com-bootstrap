      "story_html": "<p>While he was still in high school, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen' title='Wikipedia page for Woody Allen' target='_blank'>Woody Allen</a> started writing one-liners for established comedians.  This led to writing for and even appearing on TV shows such as the Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.</p><h4>Hated Doing Standup</h4><p>In the 1960s he started doing stand-up.  He hated it!  This quote makes it sound like he is a bit Introverted:</p><blockquote>I kept saying, <q>I'm not funny, I'm not a comic, you know, I can't do this, I hate it, I don't like the hours, I'm shy, you know I don't like standing in front of an audience.</q> I mean there was nothing about it I liked.  I kept saying <q>I want to quit, I want to quit.</q></blockquote><h4>Writer, Director, Auteur</h4><p>Woody went on to be a playwright, and this led to filmmaking.  Writing screenplays led to work as a director, and this led to him writing, directing, and starring in a series of successful films.</p><p>It turned out that like Hitchcock and Truffaut, Woody worked best as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur' title='Wikipedia page for auteur' target='_blank'>auteur</a>, someone who had complete control over all creative aspects of a film.  But making the shift from comedy to drama proved to be more difficult than expected.</p><blockquote>It's harder for me, and I embarrass myself more readily, but I get more pleasure out of failing in a project that I am enthused over, than in succeeding in a project that I know I can do well.</blockquote><h4>The Quantity Theory</h4><p>A more pragmatic person would have more Yellow in their spiritual portrait &mdash; and probably more money in their bank account.  As an <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to the gallery page containing my self portraits on this site' target='_blank'>INFP myself</a>, I took my time with college, changing majors a few times and even quiting for awhile.</p><p>So I can certainly understand where he's coming from.  As The Beatles so aptly put it: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwxJUXPHvE' title='Youtube video for the song Cant Buy Me Love by The Beatles' target='_blank'>Can't Buy Me Love.</a></p><blockquote>I've been working on the quantity theory.  I feel if I keep making films and just keep making them, every once in awhile I'll get lucky and one will come out.  And that's exactly what happens.</blockquote><h4>INFPs and Our Passion Projects</h4><p>As an INFP and the creator of this site, I can relate to Woody's desire to experiment and try new things, knowing that eventually we will find something that works.  This is exactly what is going on with me and this <span class='air-quotes'>spiritual portrait</span> idea, which I am presenting on this site for the umpteenth time!</p><blockquote>There are a lot of surprises that happen between writing it, doing it, and seeing it on the screen.  Most surprises are negative.  Most surprises are, that you thought something was good or funny, and it's not....  Cause it's not easy.  If it was easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't be valuable....  There's a big difference between what you set out to make, and what you make, almost every time.</blockquote><p>Make no mistake: if this site is successful this time around, it will be in great part to the inspiration and ideas I've gotten from all of the more down-to-earth pragmatic people I've met over the past few years at the various <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' title='Home page for meetup.com' target='_blank'>meetups</a> around town.  Many of these friends will undoubtedly have more Yellow in their spiritual portraits, but like Woody I love what I do &mdash; and that's more important to people like us than the numbers in our bank accounts!</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the two-disk DVD boxed set, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895299/' title='Page on imdb.com for Woody Allen: A Documentary' target='_blank'>Woody Allen: A Documentary</a>.</p>",

I appreciate your [Laura Poitras' and Glenn Greenwald's] concern for my safety, but I already know how this will end for me, and I accept the risk.</blockquote><p>As a firmly decisive and logical person, it's easy to see how Edward could feel he had no choice but to do what he did.  Once he learned what the government was doing, surely it was like there was a voice in his head saying something like <span class='air-quotes'>They taught me one thing in school, now they're doing something else in real life!  Hellooooo!  This does not compute!</span></p><blockquote>So, for me, it all comes down to state power against the people's ability to meaningfully oppose that power.  And I'm sitting there, uh, every day getting paid to design methods to amplify that state power.</blockquote><h4>Also Similar to Joffrey!?!</h4><p>As an idealist myself, I enjoy seeing idealism in others.  Hence I find it interesting to see Edward's four-letter-type matches that of the contemptuous <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2040/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Joffrey Baratheon on this site' target='_blank'>Joffrey Baratheon</a> from Game of Thrones.</p><p>Note however that Edward's image has a significant amout of Red, while Joffrey's image has a lot more Green and less Red &mdash; indicating that Edward has more compassion for others than Joffrey.  This explains their different values when it comes to human lives other than their own.</p><p>In addition to being idealistic, Edward is also obviously fearless, and after watching the movie I can't help but be glad he did what he did.</p><blockquote>These are public issues, these are not my issues you know, these are everybody's issues.  I'm not afraid of you, you know.  You're not going to bully me into silence like you've done to everybody else.  And if nobody else is gonna do it, I will, and hopefully when I'm gone, whatever you do to me, there will be somebody else who'll do the same thing.</blockquote><h4>A Stressful Time for Him</h4><p>It is important to realize that, because this personality profile is based only on the film Citizenfour, it may not be completely accurate.  This is because Ed was obviously under a great deal of stress during this time, even though he doesn't show it that much outwardly.</p><p>So the profile may not accurately show who he is in his typical day-to-day life during less stressful times.</p><p>Now that the dust has settled, I can't help but wonder how he feels about his actions and their end results &mdash; including the fact he must live in exile.</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based only on what I learned about Edward from watching <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Poitras' title='Wikipedia page for Laura Poitras' target='_blank'>Laura Poitras'</a> movie about him, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/' title='Imdb.com page for Citizenfour' target='_blank'>Citizenfour</a>.</p><p>If you would like to learn more about Ed Snowden, and perhaps support him with a donation, visit his site at <a href='https://www.edwardsnowden.com/' title='Home page of edwardsnowden.com' target='_blank'>edwardsnowden.com</a>.</p>",

You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.</blockquote><p>Pithy and filled with positive energy, she was full of words to remember and phrases to live by:</p><blockquote>You can often change your circumstances by changing your attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Happiness is not a goal ... it's a by-product of a life well lived.</blockquote><blockquote>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</blockquote><blockquote>It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.</blockquote><h4>Last but Not Least!</h4><p>I've saved the best &mdash; from my point of view, anyway &mdash; for last:</p><blockquote>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.  You are able to say to yourself, <q>I have lived through this horror.  I can take the next thing that comes along.</q>  You must do the thing you think you cannot do.</blockquote><p>I love this quote because it's scary to create a site like this!  What if someone hacks it?  What if people make fun of me for trying to draw personalities?  I see the look in the eyes of people when I tell them about it.  What if someone steals my idea?

And being versatile certainly helps a single person run an under-developed island nation alone, as a dictator.</p><h4>Passionate Idealist</h4><p>The Red and Blue in this image reflects the fact that Fidel had a passion for ideals &mdash; especially revolutionary ideals.  Reading a few of his quotes makes this obvious right away, as many belie a strong tendency to believe in people and the power of mind over matter.</p><blockquote>Condemn me, it does not matter: history will absolve me.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='https://www.marxists.org/history/cuba/archive/castro/1953/10/16.htm' title='Link to History Will Absolve Me at marxists.org' target='_blank'>History Will Absolve Me</a>, 1954.</blockquote><blockquote>Warfare is a means and not an end.  Warfare is a tool of revolutionaries.  The important thing is the revolution!

In this quote he lists the reasons for his hatred:</p><blockquote>With what moral authority can they speak of human rights &mdash; the rulers of a nation in which the millionaire and beggar coexist; the Indian is exterminated; the black man is discriminated against; the woman is prostituted; and the great masses of Chicanos, Puerto Ricans, and Latin Americans are scorned, exploited, and humiliated? How can they do this &mdash; the bosses of an empire where the mafia, gambling, and child prostitution are imposed; where the CIA organizes plans of global subversion and espionage, and the Pentagon creates neutron bombs capable of preserving material assets and wiping out human beings; an empire that supports reaction and counter-revolution all over the world; that protects and promotes the exploitation by monopolies of the wealth and the human resources of whole continents, unequal exchange, a protectionist policy, an incredible waste of natural resources, and a system of hunger for the world?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From a <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro' title='Link to the page for Fidel Castro at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>speech on the 25th anniversary</a> of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moncada_Barracks' title='Wikipedia page for the Moncada Barracks' target='_blank'>Moncada Barracks</a> attack, July 26, 1978.</blockquote><p>This passage has it all.  There's the idealism (Blue&ndash;i<q>N</q>tuition) in speaking about morals and human rights, along with the list of facts (Yellow&ndash;<q>S</q>ensation) describing America's violation of these ideals, and the emotion (Red&ndash;<q>F</q>eeling) felt when witnessing people mistreated, along with the objective (Green&ndash;<q>T</q>hinking) desire for equality.  His spiritual portrait makes it easy to see how he could exhibit all of these qualities in a single paragraph of a single speech.</p><p>More than anything, though, this tirade shows decisiveness.  He has made up his mind on this issue and it is clear no one will be changing it!</p><h4>MAD!?!</h4><p>There's more.  Castro's feelings toward the US were frighteningly irrational, as evidenced in this call for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_assured_destruction' title='Wikipedia page for mutually assured destruction' target='_blank'>mutually assured destruction</a> (MAD):</p><blockquote>I propose the immediate launching of a nuclear strike on the United States.

      "story_html": "<p>This spiritual portrait of Imelda Marcos, the infamous First Lady of the Philippines, reflects her fairly strong preferences for ideas and emotion (over facts and logic) with ample amounts of Blue and Red (and very little Yellow and Green).</p><p>It may seem surprising that someone who put so much emphasis on beauty &mdash; ostensibly a surface quality &mdash; would be an idealist.  It turns out that Imelda actually equates beauty with god and love:</p><blockquote>It is not expensive to be beautiful.  It takes only a little effort, to be presentable, and beautiful.  But, it takes some effort.  And E for effort.  And unfortunately, people think of beauty as luxury; of beauty as frivolity, no!  Or extravagant.  Beauty is a discipline.  Beauty is art, is harmony, in the ideological sense.  And in the theological sense beauty is god and love made real.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>Given her point of view, it's easy to see how Imelda's obsession with appearances in general and shoes (<q>I did not have three thousand pairs of shoes, I had one thousand and sixty.</q>) in particular is based on idealism.  And from her point of view this infatuation is based not on selfishness but on her concern for the poor, <q>little</q> people in her country.</p><blockquote>I am my little people's star and slave. When I go out into the barrios, I get dressed because I know my little people want to see a star. Other presidents' wives have gone to the barrios wearing housedresses and slippers. That's not what people want to see. People want someone they can love, someone to set an example.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Imelda_Marcos' title='Link to quote from The LA Times at wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>The LA Times</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>The movie about her life, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>, directed by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225035/' title='Page for Ramona S. Diaz on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Ramona S. Diaz</a>, is an enjoyable, enlightening, and <q><a href='http://thingsasian.com/story/film-review-imelda-power-myth-illusion' title='Link to a review of the movie at thingsasian.com' target='_blank'>nicely balanced view</a></q> of her before, during, and after her time as First Lady of the Philippines.  It includes a scene in which she reads from her book &mdash; a book she introduces with a rather surprising yet refreshing bit of humility.</p><p>There is a <a href='https://www.facebook.com/CirclesOFLifeImeldaMarcos/' title='Link to the facebook page for Circles of Life by Imelda Marcos at .com org' target='_blank'>Facebook page</a> for her book and a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4tdtEtJjzo' title='Video about the book Circles of Life by Imelda Marcos on youtube.com' target='_blank'>video about it</a> on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/' title='Home page of youtube.com' target='_blank'>youtube.com</a>.  Following is a quote she reads from <q>Circles of Life</q> in the movie:</p><blockquote>All the things that you see around you, they become the elements of your infrastructure.  But they can only be good as they are beautiful, and beauty is in the landscape of your heart.  Do not leave it there.  Paint it, shape it, build it, let it flow from within you, in everything you do or touch.  It is easy to be beautiful, because it is magical.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Quoted from <q>Circles of Life</q> by Imelda Marcos in the movie <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>Given her apparently gentle and caring nature, it's rather difficult to believe that her husband, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos' title='Wikipedia page for Ferdinand Marcos' target='_blank'>Ferdinand Marcos</a>, ruled the Philippines as president from 1966 through 1986.  This period includes the time he spent as dictator, starting in 1972 after he declared <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_No._1081' title='Wikipedia page for the proclamation of martial law in the Philippines in 1972' target='_blank'>martial law</a> and running for almost ten years &mdash; amid accusations of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos#Human_rights_abuses' title='Wikipedia page for Ferdinand Marcos, cued to the section on his human rights abuses' target='_blank'>human rights abuses</a> such as abductions, torture, and murder.</p><p>Thanks to Imelda's idealistic viewpoint, she can have her own interpretation of these events.  For example, in the movie she has this to say about the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Benigno_Aquino_Jr.' title='Wikipedia page for the Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.' target='_blank'>assassination</a> of her husband's political rival <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_Jr.' title='Wikipedia page for Benigno Aquino Jr.' target='_blank'>Benigno Aquino Jr.</a> in 1983:</p><blockquote>The events have proven that we, the Marcoses, Ferdinand and Imelda, were ultimately the victims in the assassination of [Senator Benigno <q>Ninoy</q>] Aquino [Jr.].<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda</a>, 2003.</blockquote><p>That seems to be stretching things a bit &mdash; considering the Marcoses were the ones who survived the hail of bullets!  But what can one expect from someone who uses her own name to create a word &mdash; <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Imeldific' title='Link to the word Imeldific at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'><q>Imeldific</q></a> &mdash; to describe herself?</p><p>Imelda Marcos is a colorful individual who is also surprisingly deep, and her spiritual portrait reflects that.  It's good that much of the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for the movie Imelda on imdb.com' target='_blank'>movie</a> about her features her talking about herself in her own words &mdash; so that viewers do not have to rely on a third party description of this incredible and very unique woman!</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based mainly on the movie about her life, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0160398/' title='Page for Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Imelda: Power, Myth, Illusion</a>, directed by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225035/' title='Page for Ramona S.
