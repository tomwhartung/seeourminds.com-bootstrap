In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he became a strident anti-imperialist later in life, when the Philippine–American War in 1899-1902 made him realize American imperialism was contrary to the American ideals of independence and self-government outlined in documents such as the Declaration of Independence and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.",

It is all a Dream, a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And You are but a Thought — a vagrant Thought, a useless Thought, a homeless Thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3186/3186-h/3186-h.htm' title='Link to a copy of The Mysterious Stranger at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Mysterious Stranger</a>.</blockquote><p>No. 44's claim is surprisingly extreme, and coming from a humorist, it sounds pretty bleak!

He also understood the <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=corollary' title='Link to the page for the term corollary at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>corollary</a> of this idea, that <a href='https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/humor-sapiens/201209/when-do-tragedies-become-funny' title='Link to an article about when tragedy becomes comedy at www.psychologytoday.com' target='_blank'>tragedy and comedy</a> are closely related &mdash; that <q><a href='https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/257244-humor-is-tragedy-plus-time' title='Link to a page containing the quote humor is tragedy plus time at www.goodreads.com humor is tragedy plus time' target='_blank'>humor is tragedy plus time</a></q> &mdash; that it's just a matter of perspective.</p><h4>Mark Twain, a Jedi Knight?</h4><p>The Blue in Mark Twain's spiritual portrait represents this preference for viewing the world in terms of ideas &mdash; and even just dreams &mdash; rather than facts and other specifics.  In addition to demonstrating this preference, the following quote sounds much like a lesson a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Jedi' target='_blank'>Jedi Knight</a> might teach his <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Padawan' title='Link to the Wookieepedia page for padawan apprentice' target='_blank'>padawan apprentice</a> in <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the Home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>:</p><blockquote>The mind exercises a powerful influence over the body. From the beginning of time, the sorcerer, the interpreter of dreams, the fortune-teller, the charlatan, the quack, the wild medicine-man, the educated physician, the mesmerist, and the hypnotist have made use of the client's imagination to help them in their work. They have all recognized the potency and availability of that force.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3187/3187-h/3187-h.htm' title='Link to a page containing the work Christian Science at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Christian Science</a>, <a href='http://www.online-literature.com/twain/christian-science/5/' title='Link to a page containing Chapter IV of Christian Science at www.online-literature.com' target='_blank'>Chapter IV</a>, 1907.</blockquote><p>Change those last two words very slightly &mdash; change <q>that force</q> to <q>the Force</q> &mdash; and this sounds just like something <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a> or <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> might say.  The fact that the Jedi's <a href='/gallery/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/' title='Link to a gallery page on this site containing spiritual portraits of Jedi and Droids'>spiritual portraits</a>, like Twain's, also contain a lot of Blue, is <em>not</em> a coincidence!</p><h4>Moral Courage</h4><p>Like the Jedi, Samuel Clemens had ideals.  But unlike the Jedi, he was not interested in fighting.  This doesn't mean he was a coward, though.</p><blockquote>It is curious that physical courage should be so common in the world, and moral courage so rare.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain in <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Eruption-Hitherto-Unpublished-Introduction-Bernard/dp/B002YSQ91U' title='Link to a page about Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Eruption: Hitherto Unpublished Pages About Men and Events</a>, edited by Bernard DeVoto, 1940.</blockquote><p>When the <a href='https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/brief-overview-american-civil-war' title='Link to a page about the Civil War at www.civilwar.org' target='_blank'>Civil War</a> began in 1861, Sam and a few friends friends joined the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the Confederate Army' target='_blank'>Confederate militia</a>.  But after just two weeks and a single <a href='http://www.abroadintheyard.com/mark-twain-brilliantly-explains-why-he-turned-his-back-on-american-civil-war/' title='Link to a page about the glorious but lopsided battle Twain and his friends won at www.abroadintheyard.com' target='_blank'>glorious victory</a>, he <a href='http://civilwarsaga.com/mark-twains-civil-war-experience/' title='Link to a page about Mark Twains Civil War Experience at civilwarsaga.com' target='_blank'>quit</a> and moved west with his brother <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/oc.html' title='Link to a page about Orion Clemens at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Orion</a>.</p><p>Twenty years after the war ended, Twain wrote a short story inspired by his brief experience in the military.  In it, he describes how going to war really doesn't make much sense:</p><blockquote>All war must be just the killing of strangers against whom you feel no personal animosity; strangers whom, in other circumstances, you would help if you found them in trouble, and who would help you if you needed it.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='http://www.classicshorts.com/stories/phctf.html' title='Link to the complete short story, The Private History of the Campaign That Failed, at www.classicshorts.com' target='_blank'>The Private History of the Campaign That Failed</a>, 1885.</blockquote><p>Although some may say Samuel Clemens lacked the physical courage necessary to fight in America's Civil War, he had perfectly good reasons for not joining in the fray.</p><p>As Mark Twain grew older, he more than made up for any lack of physical courage by demonstrating moral courage.  His moral courage is most obvious in the way he frequently spoke <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=speak%20truth%20to%20power' title='Link to the page for the term truth to power at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>truth to power</a>.</p><h4>Truth to ... Congress?</h4><p>Although the amount of power held by any single member of <a href='https://www.congress.gov/' title='Link to the Home page at Congress.gov' target='_blank'>America's Congress</a> is debatable, Mark Twain did not hesitate to publicize his <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Congress.html' title='Link to a page with quotes from Twain about Congress at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>low opinion</a> of its members throughout his career, and even after his death.</p><p>In a <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=eaSVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT724&lpg=PT724&dq=I+never+can+think+of+Judas+Iscariot+without+losing+my+temper.+To+my+mind+Judas+Iscariot+was+nothing+but+a+low,+mean,+premature,+Congressman.&source=bl&ots=nMzob00hkn&sig=iBY6lQ9NxXgsEYq1T11AJsnEPOk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinvvaOycDaAhWo34MKHRGoA9UQ6AEIQTAE#v=onepage&q=To%20my%20mind%20Judas%20Iscariot%20was%20nothing%20but%20a%20low%2C%20mean%2C%20premature%2C%20Congressman.&f=false' title='Link to a page in a book containing the letter at books.google.com' target='_blank'>letter to the editor</a> of the <a href='https://www.newspapers.com/title_1502/newyork_tribune/' title='Link to a page about the New York Tribune at www.newspapers.com' target='_blank'>New York Tribune</a> dated March 10, 1873 Twain boldly declares <q>To my mind Judas Iscariot was nothing but a low, mean, premature, Congressman.</q> And in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Following_the_Equator' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the book Following the Equator' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a> &mdash; published over twenty-five years later &mdash; Clemens shows no change of opinion:</p><blockquote>It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar, Ch. VIII, in <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm' title='Link to a page containing Following the Equator at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a>, 1897.</blockquote><p>One of Sam Clemens' funniest and most famous quotes about Congress &mdash; <q>Suppose you were an idiot.  And suppose you were a member of Congress.  But I repeat myself.</q> &mdash; appears in his autobiography, which was not published until 2010.</p><p>An article in the <a href='https://www.bostonglobe.com/' title='Link to the Home page at www.bostonglobe.com' target='_blank'>Boston Daily Globe</a> dated May 1, 1910 quotes Clemens making light of having been <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Lord.html' title='Link to a page with a photo and the article about Twain being invited to Parliament at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>invited to Parliament</a>, but never to Congress.  Although the slight made him <q>blush,</q> he notes the honor <q>was not bestowed upon Washington, Jefferson or Lincoln</q> either.</p><h4>Truth to Theodore Roosevelt</h4><p>Although Mark Twain admired presidents <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Grant_Ulysses.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Ulysses Grant at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Ulysses S. Grant</a> (Republican), <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/ClevelandGrover.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Grover Cleveland at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Grover Cleveland</a> (Democrat), <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/McKinley.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about William McKinley at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>William McKinley</a> (R) and <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Taft.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about William Howard Taft at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>William Howard Taft</a> (R), he did not care for <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Roosevelt.html' title='Link to a page with Twain quotes about Theodore Roosevelt at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Theodore Roosevelt</a> (R), who was president from 1901 through 1909.</p><p>As Clemens would make clear in his essay <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOZz_4Di-tM' title='Link to a video of a Mark Twain impersonator giving an introduction to Corn Pone Opinions on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Corn Pone Opinions</a> (<a href='http://havlicek.weebly.com/uploads/6/8/5/2/685209/corn_pone_opinions_twain.pdf' title='Link to a pdf of the entire Corn Pone Opinions essay at havlicek.weebly.com' target='_blank'>pdf</a>), he did not put much stock in political parties.  And as he made clear when <a href='http://www.peacehost.net/WhiteStar/Voices/twain.html' title='Link to a page about this at www.peacehost.net' target='_blank'>speaking to reporters</a> working for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Herald' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the New York Herald' target='_blank'>New York Herald</a> in 1900, apparently most &mdash; and quite possibly all &mdash; of his differences with <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5040/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Theodore Roosevelt on this site'>Theodore Roosevelt</a> stemmed from Twain being an outspoken anti-imperialist:</p><blockquote>It should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people [the Filipinos] free, and let them deal with their own domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, quoted in the <a href='https://www.newspapers.com/title_4528/new_york_herald/' title='Link to a page about the New York Herald at www.newspapers.com' target='_blank'>New York Herald</a>, October 15, 1900.</blockquote><p>In the book <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2970.Mark_Twain' title='Link to a page about the book Mark Twain: A Life at www.goodreads.com' target='_blank'>Mark Twain: A Life</a> (2005), author <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Powers' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Ron Powers' target='_blank'>Ron Powers</a> states that at one point Theodore Roosevelt said he <q>would like to see the likes of Mark Twain skinned alive.</q>&nbsp;<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a>  Twain's and TR's conflicting opinions did not, however, keep Sam Clemens from enjoying a dinner <q>at the <a href='https://www.whitehouse.gov/' title='Link to the Home page at www.whitehouse.gov' target='_blank'>White House</a> in 1905 with <a href='http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org' title='Link to the Home page at www.theodoreroosevelt.org' target='_blank'>Theodore Roosevelt</a>, all differences forgiven.</q>&nbsp;<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p><h4>Emotions &mdash; Hard to Handle</h4><p>Mark Twain was very emotional, and had quite a temper.

He blamed himself again years later, when his first daughter, Susy, died of meningitis in 1896, while he was on tour, working to pay off his debts.</p><p>Mark Twain was devastated when his daughter Susy died, and he sunk deeper into depression when his wife died in 1904, and then deeper still when his third daugher Jean died in 1909.  Of his happy family of five, only his middle daughter Clara was still alive when Sam Clemens died on April 21, 1910, at the age of 74.</p><p>Mark Twain kept many of his most intense and darkest emotions to himself:</p><blockquote>Sometimes my feelings are so hot that I have to take the pen and put them out on paper to keep them from setting me afire inside; then all that ink and labor are wasted because I can't print the results.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=yEpSDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false' title='Link to a page about Volume 1 of the book by Twain at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Mark Twain, A Biography Volume 1</a>, 1835-1885.</blockquote><p>This is why some of Clemens' later works, such as <a href='http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3186/3186-h/3186-h.htm' title='Link to a page with the entire text of The Mysterious Stranger by Mark Twain at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>The Mysterious Stranger</a> and his <a href='http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10362.xml;style=work;brand=mtp' title='Link to a page about the Autobiography of Mark Twain at ' target='_blank'>Autobiography</a>, were not <a href='https://www.npr.org/2010/12/01/131703237/on-publishing-mark-twain-s-autobiography' title='Link to a page about publishing the autobiography at www.npr.org' target='_blank'>published</a> until after his death &mdash; when there was no longer any risk of damaging his own or his family's reputation.</p><p>In 1897 Twain wrote, <q>Every one is a moon, and has a <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm#ch66' title='Link to the source of this quote - Following the Equator (1897) - Puddnhead Wilsons New Calendar, Ch.

[Emphasis in original.]</blockquote><p>Samuel Clemens worked on his autobiography off and on throughout his life, but it was not published until the 2010s.  It spans three volumes and, even though each volume is over 700 pages, in it Twain insists <q>the biography of the man himself cannot be written.</q></p><blockquote>Life does not consist mainly &mdash; even largely &mdash; of facts and happenings. It consists mainly of the storm of thoughts that is forever blowing through one's head.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Mark Twain's <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=KRHNCQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false' title='Link to a page showing Mark Twains Autobiography, Volume 1 at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Autobiography, Volume 1</a>, 1906.</blockquote><h4>Heaven, Hell, and Happiness</h4><p>As a mind-over-matter idealist, Samuel Clemens knew the importance of illusions:</p><blockquote>Don't part with your illusions. When they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Mark Twain, from <a href='https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2895/2895-h/2895-h.htm#ch59' title='Link to a page containing the entire text of Following the Equator, cued to section 59, which contains this quote, at www.gutenberg.org' target='_blank'>Following the Equator</a>, Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar, Ch.

And yet &mdash; I am inclined to expect one.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Mark Twain's <a href='http://www.twainquotes.com/Heaven.html' title='Link to a page containing this quote and attributing it to the autobiography at www.twainquotes.com' target='_blank'>Autobiography</a>.</blockquote><p>On April 20, 1910 <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8zV1xiGqf4' title='Link to the video of Halleys Comet on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Halley's Comet</a> reached its <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Perihelion and aphelion' target='_blank'>perihelion</a> &mdash; the point in its orbit where it is closest to the sun.  And on April 21, 1910 Samuel Clemens died, having speculated this was somehow preordained:</p><blockquote>I came in with Halley's Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year (1910), and I expect to go out with it. It will be the greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's Comet.

This led to writing for and even appearing on TV shows such as the Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.</p><h4>Hated Doing Standup</h4><p>In the 1960s he started doing stand-up.  He hated it!  This quote makes it sound like he is a bit Introverted:</p><blockquote>I kept saying, <q>I'm not funny, I'm not a comic, you know, I can't do this, I hate it, I don't like the hours, I'm shy, you know I don't like standing in front of an audience.</q> I mean there was nothing about it I liked.  I kept saying <q>I want to quit, I want to quit.</q></blockquote><h4>Writer, Director, Auteur</h4><p>Woody went on to be a playwright, and this led to filmmaking.  Writing screenplays led to work as a director, and this led to him writing, directing, and starring in a series of successful films.</p><p>It turned out that like Hitchcock and Truffaut, Woody worked best as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur' title='Wikipedia page for auteur' target='_blank'>auteur</a>, someone who had complete control over all creative aspects of a film.  But making the shift from comedy to drama proved to be more difficult than expected.</p><blockquote>It's harder for me, and I embarrass myself more readily, but I get more pleasure out of failing in a project that I am enthused over, than in succeeding in a project that I know I can do well.</blockquote><h4>The Quantity Theory</h4><p>A more pragmatic person would have more Yellow in their spiritual portrait &mdash; and probably more money in their bank account.

And that's exactly what happens.</blockquote><h4>INFPs and Our Passion Projects</h4><p>As an INFP and the creator of this site, I can relate to Woody's desire to experiment and try new things, knowing that eventually we will find something that works.  This is exactly what is going on with me and this <span class='air-quotes'>spiritual portrait</span> idea, which I am presenting on this site for the umpteenth time!</p><blockquote>There are a lot of surprises that happen between writing it, doing it, and seeing it on the screen.  Most surprises are negative.  Most surprises are, that you thought something was good or funny, and it's not....  Cause it's not easy.  If it was easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't be valuable....  There's a big difference between what you set out to make, and what you make, almost every time.</blockquote><p>Make no mistake: if this site is successful this time around, it will be in great part to the inspiration and ideas I've gotten from all of the more down-to-earth pragmatic people I've met over the past few years at the various <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' title='Home page for meetup.com' target='_blank'>meetups</a> around town.

Wright's staunch forthrightness explains how his competitors and critics could admire and praise him, even while disliking and criticizing him.</p><h4>Some of Mr. Wright's Ideas</h4><p>What makes Frank Lloyd Wright's work so different from that of other architects is the insight inherent in his uniquely American ideas about architecture &mdash; and the way he expresses these insightful ideas through his designs.</p><p>Wright put forth some of his key ideas in the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11469-in-the-cause-of-architecture?v=preview' title='Link to a page about the March 1908 issue at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>March 1908 issue</a> of the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/' title='Link to the home page for the Architectual Record at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>Architectual Record</a>.</p><blockquote>A building should appear to grow easily from its site and be shaped to harmonize with its surroundings of nature if manifest there, and if not try to make it as quiet, substantial, and organic as she would have been were the opportunity hers.<br />We of the Middle West are living on the prairie.  The prairie has a beauty of its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural beauty, its quiet level.  Hence, gently sloping roofs, low proportions, quiet sky lines, suppressed heavy-set chimneys, and sheltering overhangs, low terraces and out-reaching walls sequestering private gardens.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote><p>These ideas exemplify the goals underlying the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School' title='Wikipedia page for the Prairie School' target='_blank'>Prairie School</a> of Architecture.</p><h4>Profound and Profounder</h4><p>These ideas are certainly profound, but they seem trite and superficial when compared to Frank Lloyd Wright's deeper, more general aesthetic goals:</p><blockquote>Nothing is more difficult to achieve than the integral simplicity of organic nature, amid the tangled confusions of the innumerable relics of form that encumber life for us.  To achieve it in any degree means a serious devotion to the <q>underneath</q> in an attempt to grasp the <em>nature</em> of building a beautiful building beautifully, as organically true in itself, to itself and to its purpose, as any tree and flower.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture II</q>,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1914.  [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote><p>It's easy to see how a skeptic could read this quote once and conclude Mr. Wright has a screw loose.  Perhaps the skeptic could be seduced into appreciation by a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuZ0x5Qkgzg' title='Video of a short video tour of Fallingwater on youtube.com' target='_blank'>short video tour</a> of <a href='https://www.fallingwater.org/what-is-fallingwater/' title='Link to a page about the house at www.fallingwater.org' target='_blank'>Fallingwater</a>, followed by a re-reading &mdash; or maybe two or three re-readings &mdash; of the above quote.</p><p>One of the best ways to explain an idea is often with a good example.</p><h4>The <q>Architect</q> Archetype: INT<b>X</b>?</h4><p>Fans of Jungian archetypes and the MBTI&reg; may be familiar with the <q>Architect</q> archetype.  A <a href='https://www.google.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.google.com' target='_blank'>search</a> of the internet quickly yields two common examples:</p><ul><li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(role_variant)' title='Wikipedia page for the Architect role variant' target='_blank'>Architect role variant</a> developed by <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.keirsey.com' target='_blank'>David Keirsey</a>, which identifies architects as representive of the <b>INTP</b> four-letter type.</li><li>The site <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>16personalities.com</a> refers to the <b>INTJ</b> personality type as <q><a href='https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality' title='Link to a page about the INTJ personality at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>The Architect</a>.</q></li></ul><p>As an <b>ENTJ</b>, Frank Lloyd Wright's personality was certainly close enough to the <q>ideal</q> architect.</p><p>Mr. Wright's personality was definitely on the decisive side.  In 1908 he made it plain that the best buildings were a gestalt, in which furniture and color schemes form their respective parts of the whole.</p><blockquote>The most truly satisfactory apartments are those in which most or all of the furniture is built in as a part of the original scheme.  The whole must always be considered as an integral unit.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote><p>Wright often designed the stained glass windows and furniture for his houses, and once reportedly even designed the hostess' dress.  There is even a story about a client who moved their furniture in an attempt to make the space their own, only to have Mr. Wright pay an impromptu visit and move the furniture back to where he thought it should be.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><h4>The Celebrity Architect</h4><p>More significantly, in contrast to the introversion present in the <q>ideal</q> architect, Mr. Wright was certainly extroverted.  Born in 1867, just two years after the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098769/' title='Page for the series about the Civil War by Ken Burns et.al. on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Civil War</a>, it's incredible to realize he appeared on <a href='http://www.dummies.com/education/history/american-history/the-impact-of-the-television-in-1950s-america/' title='Link to a page about television in the 1950s at www.dummies.com' target='_blank'>television</a> when it became popular in the 1950s &mdash; nearly a century later.</p><p>The crowd's reaction to Frank Lloyd Wright's <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjGopgkqpDU' title='Video on youtube.com of the appearance of Frank Lloyd Wright on Whats My Line' target='_blank'>appearance</a> on <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042168/' title='Page for Whats My Line on imdb.com' target='_blank'>What's My Line</a> in September of 1956 shows he was quite a celebrity.  Shortly after that, he was 88 in 1957 when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeKzIZAKG3E' title='Video of Frank Lloyd Wright being interviewed by Mike Wallace on youtube.com' target='_blank'>spoke with Mike Wallace</a> about controversial topics such as modern art, religion, politics, and his plans for a <a href='http://www.wrightontheweb.net/his-works/fifties/mile-high/' title='Link to a page about his plans for a mile-high skyscraper at www.wrightontheweb.net' target='_blank'>mile-high skyscraper</a>.</p><p>In Mr. Wright's case, it seems his deviation from the <q>ideal</q> &mdash; his extraversion &mdash; worked in his favor.</p><h4>So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright</h4><p>Frank Lloyd Wright died in 1959, at the age of 91.  He was so famous that <a href='http://www.simonandgarfunkel.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.simonandgarfunkel.com' target='_blank'>Simon and Garfunkel</a> wrote the song <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf0RrF6KsI8' title='Link to the song So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright at www.youtube.com' target='_blank'>So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright</a> about him in 1970, over ten years after his death and more than a hundred years after his birth.</p><p>Mr. Wright's legacy lives on, in numerous videos on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=frank+lloyd+wright' title='Link to search results for videos of Frank Lloyd Wright on youtube.com' target='_blank'>youtube.com</a>, in organizations such as the <a href='http://franklloydwright.org/' title='Link to the home page at franklloydwright.org' target='_blank'>Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation</a> and, of course in the <a href='http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/franklloydwright' title='Link to a page mapping the location of buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at worldmap.harvard.edu' target='_blank'>buildings</a> he left behind.

You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.</blockquote><p>Pithy and filled with positive energy, she was full of words to remember and phrases to live by:</p><blockquote>You can often change your circumstances by changing your attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Happiness is not a goal ... it's a by-product of a life well lived.</blockquote><blockquote>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</blockquote><blockquote>It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.</blockquote><h4>Last but Not Least!</h4><p>I've saved the best &mdash; from my point of view, anyway &mdash; for last:</p><blockquote>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.  You are able to say to yourself, <q>I have lived through this horror.  I can take the next thing that comes along.</q>  You must do the thing you think you cannot do.</blockquote><p>I love this quote because it's scary to create a site like this!  What if someone hacks it?  What if people make fun of me for trying to draw personalities?  I see the look in the eyes of people when I tell them about it.  What if someone steals my idea?
