  "description_html": "<p>Along with Clay Davis, Frank Sobotka is one of the most emotional characters on The Wire, and the image of his personality on this page reflects this warmth.  When it comes to doing business, he and his nephew Nick &mdash; who is also decisive but much more logical and cool &mdash; make a good team.</p><p>The image of Frank's son Ziggy's personality shows he is very open to new experiences, which helps explain how he often comes off as a goof-ball.  In contrast, the image of Vondas' personality is coldly logical, pragmatic, and withdrawn &mdash; all business.</p>",
