      "story_html": "<p>While he was still in high school, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen' title='Wikipedia page for Woody Allen' target='_blank'>Woody Allen</a> started writing one-liners for established comedians.  This led to writing for and even appearing on TV shows such as the Ed Sullivan Show and The Tonight Show.</p><h4>Hated Doing Standup</h4><p>In the 1960s he started doing stand-up.  He hated it!  This quote makes it sound like he is a bit Introverted:</p><blockquote>I kept saying, <q>I'm not funny, I'm not a comic, you know, I can't do this, I hate it, I don't like the hours, I'm shy, you know I don't like standing in front of an audience.</q> I mean there was nothing about it I liked.  I kept saying <q>I want to quit, I want to quit.</q></blockquote><h4>Writer, Director, Auteur</h4><p>Woody went on to be a playwright, and this led to filmmaking.  Writing screenplays led to work as a director, and this led to him writing, directing, and starring in a series of successful films.</p><p>It turned out that like Hitchcock and Truffaut, Woody worked best as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur' title='Wikipedia page for auteur' target='_blank'>auteur</a>, someone who had complete control over all creative aspects of a film.  But making the shift from comedy to drama proved to be more difficult than expected.</p><blockquote>It's harder for me, and I embarrass myself more readily, but I get more pleasure out of failing in a project that I am enthused over, than in succeeding in a project that I know I can do well.</blockquote><h4>The Quantity Theory</h4><p>A more pragmatic person would have more Yellow in their spiritual portrait &mdash; and probably more money in their bank account.  As an <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to the gallery page containing my self portraits on this site' target='_blank'>INFP myself</a>, I took my time with college, changing majors a few times and even quiting for awhile.</p><p>So I can certainly understand where he's coming from.  As The Beatles so aptly put it: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srwxJUXPHvE' title='Youtube video for the song Cant Buy Me Love by The Beatles' target='_blank'>Can't Buy Me Love.</a></p><blockquote>I've been working on the quantity theory.  I feel if I keep making films and just keep making them, every once in awhile I'll get lucky and one will come out.  And that's exactly what happens.</blockquote><h4>INFPs and Our Passion Projects</h4><p>As an INFP and the creator of this site, I can relate to Woody's desire to experiment and try new things, knowing that eventually we will find something that works.  This is exactly what is going on with me and this <span class='air-quotes'>spiritual portrait</span> idea, which I am presenting on this site for the umpteenth time!</p><blockquote>There are a lot of surprises that happen between writing it, doing it, and seeing it on the screen.  Most surprises are negative.  Most surprises are, that you thought something was good or funny, and it's not....  Cause it's not easy.  If it was easy, it wouldn't be fun, it wouldn't be valuable....  There's a big difference between what you set out to make, and what you make, almost every time.</blockquote><p>Make no mistake: if this site is successful this time around, it will be in great part to the inspiration and ideas I've gotten from all of the more down-to-earth pragmatic people I've met over the past few years at the various <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' title='Home page for meetup.com' target='_blank'>meetups</a> around town.  Many of these friends will undoubtedly have more Yellow in their spiritual portraits, but like Woody I love what I do &mdash; and that's more important to people like us than the numbers in our bank accounts!</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the two-disk DVD boxed set, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1895299/' title='Page on imdb.com for Woody Allen: A Documentary' target='_blank'>Woody Allen: A Documentary</a>.</p>",

You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.</blockquote><p>Pithy and filled with positive energy, she was full of words to remember and phrases to live by:</p><blockquote>You can often change your circumstances by changing your attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Happiness is not a goal ... it's a by-product of a life well lived.</blockquote><blockquote>No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</blockquote><blockquote>It takes as much energy to wish as it does to plan.</blockquote><h4>Last but Not Least!</h4><p>I've saved the best &mdash; from my point of view, anyway &mdash; for last:</p><blockquote>You gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face.  You are able to say to yourself, <q>I have lived through this horror.  I can take the next thing that comes along.</q>  You must do the thing you think you cannot do.</blockquote><p>I love this quote because it's scary to create a site like this!

His preference is moderate, so his portrait also contains a bit of Red, representing his ability to make emotional decisions when he thought it was appropriate.</p><p>Architecture is obviously an occupation in which its practitioners need to be logical.  They must know how to use math and geometry to design their structures using precise specifications that everyone building the edifice can understand and use to get their job done.</p><h4>... And Feeling, Too?</h4><p>Frank Lloyd Wright's buildings are bold and distinctive, and it can seem like they have <q>feeling.</q>  Indeed, in <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11500-in-the-cause-of-architecture-ii-style-therefore-will-be-the-man-it-is-his-let-his-forms-alone?v=preview' title='Link to a page about the article by Frank Lloyd Wright at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>an article</a> in the May 1914 issue of the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>Architectural Record</a> he states how, during his apprenticship at the firm of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dankmar_Adler' title='Wikipedia page for Dankmar Adler' target='_blank'>Adler</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Sullivan' title='Wikipedia page for Louis Sullivan' target='_blank'>Sullivan</a>, he learned to use the opposing processes of thinking and feeling to create <q>a sentient, rational building:</q></p><blockquote>This ideal combination of Adler and Sullivan was then working to produce what no other combination of achitects nor any individual architect at that time dared even preach: a sentient, rational building that would owe its 'style' to the integrity with which it was individually fashioned to serve its particular purpose; a 'thinking' as well as a 'feeling' process, requiring the independent work of true artist imagination.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture II</q>,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1914.</blockquote><p>Interestingly enough, Wright confessed to feeling more emotion for some of his buildings than for his children:</p><blockquote>I have had the father feeling for a building, but I never had it for my children.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a></blockquote><p>As far as Mr. Wright's morality and family life goes, he felt he was above all that.  Ultimately, the validity of his claim is in the ethics and conscience of the beholder.</p><h4>Expressing Ideas</h4><p>The Blue in Frank Lloyd Wright's spiritual portrait represents his preference for ideas over facts.  His definition of architecture in the <a href='http://www.steinerag.com/flw/Periodicals/ArchForum.htm' title='Link to a page about the May, 1930 issue at www.steinerag.com' target='_blank'>May, 1930 issue</a> of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_Forum' title='Wikipedia page for the Architectural Forum' target='_blank'>Architectural Forum</a> as <q>the scientific art of making structure express ideas</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> confirms how he considered ideas to be the central elements of his work.</p><p>Mr. Wright began his career in Chicago in 1888 as an apprentice working for Louis Sullivan, who is famous for espousing the idea that <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_follows_function' title='Wikipedia page for form follows function' target='_blank'>form follows function</a>.</q>  At first Wright embraced his boss's idea, but years later, it was clear he had moved beyond such obvious observations:</p><blockquote><q>Form follows function</q> is mere dogma until you realize the higher truth that form and function are one.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright, from the Architect's Journal, August, 1936.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a></blockquote><h4>Organic Architecture</h4><p>Wright took the idea of <q><a href='https://www.guggenheim.org/arts-curriculum/topic/form-follows-function' title='Link to a page about form follows function at www.guggenheim.org' target='_blank'>form follows function</a></q> and developed it into an entire philosophy he called <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_architecture' title='Wikipedia page for organic architecture' target='_blank'>organic architecture</a>.</q>  In <q><a href='https://www.amazon.com/Disappearing-City-Frank-Lloyd-Wright/dp/B0000EF481' title='Link to a page about the book The Disappearing City at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>The Disappearing City</a></q> &mdash; his plan for the development of his concept for the ultimate suburbia he called <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadacre_City' title='Wikipedia page for Broadacre City' target='_blank'>Broadacre City</a></q> &mdash; he goes so far as to say:</p><blockquote>I now realize that organic architecture is life and life itself is organic architecture or both are in vain.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1932.</blockquote><p>Regardless of how his critics might feel about Frank Lloyd Wright and his work, most everyone has to admire a person who approaches their life's work with such dedication and sincerity.  Wright's staunch forthrightness explains how his competitors and critics could admire and praise him, even while disliking and criticizing him.</p><h4>Some of Mr. Wright's Ideas</h4><p>What makes Frank Lloyd Wright's work so different is his insightful, uniquely American ideas about architecture, and the way he expresses these ideas through his designs.</p><p>Wright put forth some of his key ideas in the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/11469-in-the-cause-of-architecture?v=preview' title='Link to a page about the March 1908 issue at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>March 1908 issue</a> of the <a href='https://www.architecturalrecord.com/' title='Link to the home page for the Architectual Record at www.architecturalrecord.com' target='_blank'>Architectual Record</a>.</p><blockquote>A building should appear to grow easily from its site and be shaped to harmonize with its surroundings of nature is manifest there.  We of the Middle West are living on the prairie.  The prairie has a beauty of its own and we should recognize and accentuate this natural beauty, it's quiet level.  Hence, gently sloping roofs, low proportions, quiet sky lines, suppressed heavy-set chimneys, and sheltering overhangs, low terraces and out-reaching walls sequestering provate gardens.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote><p>These ideas exemplify the goals underlying the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School' title='Wikipedia page for the Prairie School' target='_blank'>Prairie School</a> of Architecture.</p><h4>Profound and Profounder</h4><p>As profound as these ideas are, however, they are trite and superficial when compared to Frank Lloyd Wrights deeper, more general aesthetic goals:</p><blockquote>Nothing is more difficult to achieve than the integral simplicity of organic nature, amid the tangled confusions of the innumerable relics of form that encumber life for us.  To achieve it in any degree means a serious devotion to the <q>underneath</q> in an attempt to grasp the <em>nature</em> of building a beautiful building beautifully, as organically true in itself, to itself and to its purpose, as any tree and flower.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture II</q>,<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a> 1914.</blockquote><p>It's easy to see how a skeptic could read this and conclude Mr. Wright has a screw loose.

A <a href='https://www.google.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.google.com' target='_blank'>search</a> of the internet quickly yields two common examples:</p><ul><li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect_(role_variant)' title='Wikipedia page for the Architect role variant' target='_blank'>Architect role variant</a> developed by <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.keirsey.com' target='_blank'>David Keirsey</a>, which identifies architects as representive of the <b>INTP</b> four-letter type.</li><li>The site <a href='https://www.16personalities.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>16personalities.com</a> refers to the <b>INTJ</b> personality type as <q><a href='https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality' title='Link to a page about the INTJ personality at www.16personalities.com' target='_blank'>The Architect</a>.</q></li></ul><p>As an <b>ENTJ</b>, Frank Lloyd Wright was certainly on the decisive side.  In 1908 he made it plain that the best buildings were a gestalt, in which furniture and color schemes form their respective parts of the whole.</p><blockquote>The most truly satisfactory apartments are those in which most or all of the furniture is built in as a part of the original scheme.  The whole must always be considered as an integral unit.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Frank Lloyd Wright in <q>In the Cause of Architecture, I</q><a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a>, 1908.</blockquote><p>There are even stories about clients who moved their furniture in an attempt to make the space their own, only to have Mr. Wright pay an impromptu visit and move the furniture back to where he thought it should be.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><h4>The Extraverted Architect</h4><p>More significantly, Mr. Wright was certainly extroverted.
