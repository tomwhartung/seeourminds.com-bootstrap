In Introverts, the dominant trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he remains focused when fighting, refusing to let emotions like fear interfere with his determination to vanquish his opponent.",

In Introverts, the auxiliary trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a vertical line to represent this, because it is more evident than the dominant function.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he performs psychokinesis, using his powers of concentration to get The Force to move objects.",
