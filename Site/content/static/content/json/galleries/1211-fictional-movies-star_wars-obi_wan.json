      "explain_dom": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Obi-Wan Kenobi's dominant personality trait, his strong preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions.  In Introverts, the dominant trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he remains focused when fighting, refusing to let emotions like fear interfere with his determination to vanquish his opponent.",

In Introverts, the auxiliary trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a vertical line to represent this, because it is more evident than the dominant function.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he performs psychokinesis, using his powers of concentration to get The Force to move objects.",

He tells Luke his take on what the force is in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>:</p><blockquote>The force is what gives a Jedi his power.  It's an energy field created by all living things, it surrounds us, it penetrates us, it binds the galaxy together.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Obi-Wan Kenobi in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>In <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, the force is most visible when a Jedi or <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/sith' title='Link to a page about the Sith at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Sith</a> uses their powers of <a href='http://www.psychokinesispowers.com/definition' title='Link to a page defining psychokinesis at www.psychokinesispowers.com' target='_blank'>psychokinesis</a>, and when a Jedi dies then returns as a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Force_spirit' title='Link to a page about force spirits at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>force spirit</a>.</p><h4>Seeing the Force</h4><p>After having been killed by <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker' title='Wookieepedia page for Anakin Skywalker' target='_blank'>Darth Vader</a>, Obi-Wan Kenobi demonstrates how his force spirit lives on, when he appears to Luke in a snowstorm.</p><p>Near the beginning of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>, Luke has fallen down face-first in the snow and is lying there, barely conscious.  Suddenly Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to him, as if in a dream:</p><blockquote>Obi-Wan Kenobi: Luke.  Luke!<br />Luke Skywalker: Ben?<br />Obi-Wan: You will go to the Dagobah system.<br />Luke: Dagobah system.<br />Obi-Wan: There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.<br />Luke: Ben!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>Obi-Wan's image quickly fades and the welcome sight of the real live Han Solo, coming to the rescue, replaces it.</p><h4>Keep Calm and Cut off His Legs</h4><p>The Green in Obi-Wan Kenobi's spiritual portrait represents his strong preference for logical decisions &mdash; and his knowledge of how emotions can cloud a Jedi's thinking, leading to disaster.</p><p>Obi-Wan's preference for rationality enables him to keep his cool when confronting an anguished <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker, aka. Darth Vader, on this site'>Anakin Skywalker</a> on <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mustafar' title='Wookieepedia page for Mustafar' target='_blank'>Mustafar</a>, a volcanic planet.  Distraught about losing his wife <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1220/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Padme on this site'>Padme</a>, Anakin begins making irrational accusations in their climactic duel near the end of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a>:</p><blockquote>Anakin Skywalker: You turned her against me!<br />Obi-Wan Kenobi: You have done that yourself.<br />Anakin: You will not take her from me!<br />Obi-Wan: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Revenge of the Sith</a>, 2005.</blockquote><p>Anakin's emotional allegations ring hollow in contrast to Obi-Wan's reasonable responses.</p><h4>Yoda and Luke, and the Siths</h4><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi's spiritual portrait looks very similar to the portraits of <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a> and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a>.  All three have significant amounts of Blue, representing their idealistic belief in the force, and Green, representing their preference for being logical.</p><p>In contrast, Obi-Wan's spiritual portrait looks very different from the portraits of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Sith_Lord' title='Wookieepedia page for Sith Lords' target='_blank'>Sith Lords</a>, <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Darth Vader on this site'>Darth Vader</a> and <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1226/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Darth Sidious on this site'>Darth Sidious</a>.  The Sith Lords' portraits lack the Blue of the Jedi's &mdash; they have lost their idealistic view of the force, and see it only as a means to personal power.</p><h4>Good and Evil: Not Just a Point of View</h4><p>In <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a> Darth Sidious tells Anakin Skywalker that <q>Good is a point of view.</q>  Using lies like this, Sidious successfully seduces Anakin to the dark side, and Anakin becomes Darth Vader.</p><p>Darth Sidious and Darth Vader go on to create a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star' title='Link to a page about the Death Star at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Death Star</a> and use it in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV, A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV, A New Hope</a> to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Disaster' title='Wookieepedia page for the destruction of Alderaan' target='_blank'>destroy Alderaan</a>, a totally peaceful planet &mdash; all to serve their lust for power.</p><p>In contrast, the Jedi have ideals, such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle' title='Wikipedia page for the principle of non-agression' target='_blank'>principle of non-agression</a>.  As Yoda teaches Luke on Dagobah in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>:</p><blockquote>Luke: How am I to know the good side from the bad?<br />Yoda: You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive.  A Jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense, never attack.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>It is clear the Sith's death star is not for defense, but for attacking others and even destroying entire planets.  In choosing the dark side and destroying a peaceful planet, the Sith Lords show their contempt for Jedi ideals and the Jedi <q>point of view.</q></p><h4>Idealism Does Not Imply Virtue</h4><p>It is important to realize that, while the idealism of the Jedi correlates to respect for others in the Star Wars universe, this is not necessarily true everywhere.  Just because someone is idealistic does not mean they are virtuous and treat other people with kindness and respect.</p><p>Most importantly, whether someone is good is not a matter of whether they are idealistic, but rather it depends on the nature of their ideals &mdash; and even more so on how they actually treat other people.</p><p>Moreover, regardless of Anakin's psychological preferences and the content of his spiritual portrait, he proved Luke was right when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOQI-LAEzM' title='Video of Darth Vader aka. Anakin killing Palpatine aka. Darth Sidious on youtube.com' target='_blank'>killed Sidious</a> at the end of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>.</p><p>In saving Luke from certain death at the hands of Darth Sidious, Anakin proved that he &mdash; the feared, monstrous Darth Vader &mdash; still had some good in him.</p><hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at ' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
