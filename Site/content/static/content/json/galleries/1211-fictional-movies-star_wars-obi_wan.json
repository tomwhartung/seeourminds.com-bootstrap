      "explain_dom": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Obi-Wan Kenobi's dominant personality trait, his strong preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions.  In Introverts, the dominant trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he remains focused when fighting, refusing to let emotions like fear interfere with his determination to vanquish his opponent.",
      "explain_aux": "The Blue in this spiritual portrait represents Obi-Wan Kenobi's auxiliary personality trait, his preference for seeing the world more in terms of ideas than facts.  In Introverts, the auxiliary trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a vertical line to represent this, because it is more evident than the dominant function.  Obi-Wan demonstrates this trait when he performs psychokinesis, using his powers of concentration to get The Force to move objects.",
