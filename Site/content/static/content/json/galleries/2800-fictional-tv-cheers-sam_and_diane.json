  "description_html": "<p>The turbulent relationship between Sam Malone and Diane Chambers on <a href='http://cheers.wikia.com/wiki/Cheers_Wiki' title='Link to the Home page at cheers.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Cheers</a> forms the basis for much of what goes on during the first five seasons of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the term sitcom' target='_blank'>sitcom</a>.  Their relationship is so well-known there is even a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_and_Diane' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Sam and Diane' target='_blank'>wikipedia page</a> for the couple!</p><p>Sam and Diane not only have very different backgrounds, they have very different temperaments.  The Yellow and Green in Sam's spiritual portrait shows he is more down-to-earth and logical, while the Blue and Red in Diane's image shows she prefers learning new ideas and expressing her emotions.

I was somewhat surprised to see a whole page in the Wikipedia devoted to their relationship, and after some thought decided to re-watch all <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/episodes?season=1' title='Link to the page for the episode guide for Cheers, cued to season 1, on imdb.com' target='_blank'>eleven seasons</a> (271 episodes) of the show.</p><p>Although I'd seen most of them long ago, it was nice to watch them all again.  And re-watcing all of them systematically filled in a few gaps &mdash; plot points and even entire shows that I'd either forgotten about or missed somehow.</p><p>The results appear here and in the other Cheers galleries.  I hope you enjoy the images and stories!</p><p>To learn when I post new images and stories, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/seeourminds' title='Link to small form you can use to join the Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com email list' target='_blank'>join the SeeOurMinds.com email list</a>!</p>",

As a handsome, virule, sports figure, Sam frequently finds the stimulation he needs by seducing women, and he finds young, pretty women to be particularly alluring.</p><p>Just as Diane seems to have difficulty settling on a specific course of study, Sam has difficulty deciding on a specific woman:</p><blockquote>Rebecca Howe: [to Sam] What do you say when you break up with a woman?<br>Sam Malone: I usually say, 'I'll call you tomorrow'.<br>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539677/' title='Link to the page for A Diminished Rebecca With a Suspended Cliff on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A Diminished Rebecca With a Suspended Cliff</a>, 1992.</blockquote><p>Today that's called <q>ghosting,</q> and it might sound harsh, but then compared to King Henry the Eighth, Sam's a real sweetheart.</p><h4>Opposites Attract?</h4><p>Sam and Diane share a tendency to be indecisive, and it's possible that without this indecisiveness, they may not have been open to sharing a relationship in the first place.  Digging a little deeper, it's apparent they have opposing interests.</p><p>That Sam and Diane are opposites, at least in some respects, is obvious.  In the episode <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0788354/' title='Link to the page for Teachers Pet on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Teacher's Pet</a>, Sam admits his <q>brain doesn't work like</q> Diane's, because he <q>can't learn things.</q></p><p>These opposing interests may contribute to the powerful attraction they feel &mdash; at least at first.  Inevitably though, after the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona-RhLfRfc' title='Link to the video of the Monty Python nudge nudge wink wink skit on youtube.com' target='_blank'>initial passion</a> they feel wears off, they find the things they are interested in are entirely different.  So when they try to spend a significant amount of time together, disaster, and hilarity, ensues.</p><h4>Tell Me More! No Wait, Just Kidding, Please Don't!</h4><p>After some ups-and-downs that are both entertaining and heartbreaking, Diane convinces Sam to go with her to see a counselor.
