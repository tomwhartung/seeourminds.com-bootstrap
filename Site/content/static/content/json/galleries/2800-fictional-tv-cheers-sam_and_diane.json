  "description_html": "<p>The turbulent relationship between Sam Malone and Diane Chambers on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the show Cheers' target='_blank'>Cheers</a> forms the basis for much of what goes on during the first five seasons of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the term sitcom' target='_blank'>sitcom</a>.  Their relationship is so well-known there is even a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_and_Diane' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Sam and Diane' target='_blank'>wikipedia page</a> for the couple!</p><p>Sam and Diane not only have very different backgrounds, they have very different temperaments.  The Yellow and Green in Sam's spiritual portrait shows he is more down-to-earth and logical, while the Blue and Red in Diane's image shows she prefers learning new ideas and expressing her emotions.

  "story_html": "<p>When I first started writing the stories for <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1203/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Leia Organa on this site'>Leia Organa</a> and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1206/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Han Solo on this site'>Han Solo</a> &mdash; characters from the <a href='/gallery/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/' title='Link to a gallery page on this site containing spiritual portraits of characters from the Original Star Wars trilogy'>Original Star Wars trilogy</a> &mdash; on <a href='https://www.seeourminds.com' title='Link to the Home page at SeeOurMinds.com' target='_blank'>this site</a>, the term <q>Sam and Diane</q> popped into my head, suddenly and totally unbidden.  I was somewhat surprised to see a whole page in the Wikipedia devoted to their relationship, and after some thought decided to re-watch all <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083399/episodes?season=1' title='Link to the page for the episode guide for Cheers, cued to season 1, on imdb.com' target='_blank'>eleven seasons</a> (271 episodes) of the show.</p><p>Although I'd seen most of them long ago, it was nice to watch them all again.  And re-watcing all of them systematically filled in a few gaps &mdash; plot points and even entire shows that I'd either forgotten about or missed somehow.</p><p>The results appear here and in the other Cheers galleries.  I hope you enjoy the images and stories!</p><p>To learn when I post new images and stories, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/seeourminds' title='Link to small form you can use to join the Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com email list' target='_blank'>join the SeeOurMinds.com email list</a>!</p>",
