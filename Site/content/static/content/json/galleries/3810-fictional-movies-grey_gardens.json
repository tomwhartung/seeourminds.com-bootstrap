It was a special occasion and I had no idea what I was in for.</p><p>The Beales' voices echoed in my mind for a week.  This is extremely rare &mdash; an excellent film might continue to affect me for a day &mdash; so the film made a huge impression on me!</p><p>These profiles are based on the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073076/?ref_=nv_sr_1' title='Page on imdb.com for the original Grey Gardens film' target='_blank'>original film</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beales_of_Grey_Gardens' title='Wikipedia page for the follow-up film Beales of Grey Gardens' target='_blank'>follow-up</a> only, <b>not</b> the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758751/?ref_=nv_sr_2' title='Page on imdb.com for the 2009 HBO remake of Grey Gardens' target='_blank'>remake</a> (even though the remake does an excellent job of extending rather than distorting the real thing).</p><p>Their Extraversion explains why they sometimes seem to compete for attention from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_and_David_Maysles' title='Wikipedia page for Albert and David Maysles' target='_blank'>filmmakers</a>.  This sometimes deteriorates into bickering, but even then it's fun to watch.</p><p>And it's easy to see how some people &mdash; relatives, for example &mdash; might sense their openness, and try to condescend or even take advantage.  These people are in for a big surprise, however, because beneath the surface, Little Edie is most definitely a <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-VnU3WQuyk' title='Link to the youtube video, S.T.A.U.N.C.H.' target='_blank'>Staunch Character</a>!</q></p><p>If you have not seen this historic film, I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It's easy to find online, but I was able to find it in the <a href='https://www.denverlibrary.org/' title='Link to the home page of the Denver Public Library' target='_blank'>Denver Public Library</a>, so I could watch it over and over, and share it with some friends.</p>",
