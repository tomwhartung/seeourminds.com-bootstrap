But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by <em>the equal rights of others.</em>&nbsp;[Emphasis added.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson, in a <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson#1810s' title='Link to the section on the 1810s on the page for Thomas Jefferson at en.wikiquote.org, containing the Letter to Isaac H.

Tiffany</a>, April 4, 1819.</blockquote><p>Jefferson's idealism certainly helped make the transition to the United States' new and unique system of government &mdash; once independence from Britain was attained &mdash; relatively peaceful.  In contrast, the transitions of some other countries since then have been quite the opposite.</p><p>From France's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror' title='Wikipedia page for the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution' target='_blank'>Reign of Terror</a> in the late 1790s to more recent conflicts such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring' title='Wikipedia page for Arab Spring' target='_blank'>Arab Spring</a> of the early 2010s, Americans were and continue to be fortunate to have individuals such as Jefferson &mdash; and the countless others he inspired &mdash; step up and make their ideals well known.</p><p>Surely everyone would agree that any sort of violence is the ultimate act of disrespect for <em><q>the equal rights of others.</q></em></p><h4>He Just Feels Like it Sometimes</h4><p>Thomas Jefferson is famous for authoring the <a href='http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/' title='Full text of the Declaration of Independence at ushistory.org' target='_blank'>Declaration of Independence</a>, but a letter he wrote to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway' title='Wikipedia page for Maria Cosway' target='_blank'>Maria Cosway</a> in the spring of 1786 shows a strong awareness and appreciation of the psychological opposites that fans of the <a href='http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/home.htm?bhcp=1' title='Link to the home page at www.myersbriggs.org' target='_blank'>MBTI&reg;</a> call <a href='http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/thinking-or-feeling.htm' title='Link to the page about thinking and feeling at www.myersbriggs.org' target='_blank'><em><q>T</q>hinking</em> and <em><q>F</q>eeling</em></a>.</p><p>Jefferson wrote this letter over 135 years before <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung' title='Wikipedia page for Carl Jung' target='_blank'>Carl Jung</a> would articulate his observances in his <a href='http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Jung/types.htm' title='Link to the General Description of the Types at psychclassics.yorku.ca' target='_blank'>General Description of the Types</a> in 1923.  The letter articulates &mdash; in an extremely personal and revealing manner &mdash; the distinction between the Thinking (Green) and Feeling (Red) functions playing a part in the four-letter-types created and popularized by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cook_Briggs' title='Wikipedia page for Katharine Cook Briggs' target='_blank'>Katharine Cook Briggs</a> and her daughter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabel_Briggs_Myers' title='Wikipedia page for Isabel Briggs Myers' target='_blank'>Isabel Briggs Myers</a> around that same time.</p><p>Following are some excerpts from <a href='http://www.pbs.org/jefferson/archives/documents/frame_ih195811.htm' title='Copy of the My Head and My Heart letter at in the archives at pbs.org' target='_blank'>My Head and My Heart</a>:</p><blockquote>Seated by my fireside, solitary & sad, the following dialogue took place between my Head &amp; my Heart:<br />Head: Well, friend, you seem to be in a pretty trim.<br />Heart: I am indeed the most wretched of all earthly beings.  Overwhelmed with grief, every fibre of my frame distended beyond its natural powers to bear, I would willingly meet whatever catastrophe should leave me no more to feel or to fear.<br />Head: These are the eternal consequences of your warmth &amp; precipitation.  This is one of the scrapes into which you are ever leading us....<br />Heart: Oh, my friend! This is no moment to upbraid my foibles.  I am rent into fragments by the force of my grief! ....<br />Head: On the contrary I never found that the moment of triumph with you was the moment of attention to my admonitions....  Harsh therefore as the medicine may be, it is my office to administer it....<br />Heart: Accordingly, Sir, this acquaintance was not the consequence of my doings.  It was one of your projects which threw us in the way of it....<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Excerpts from <em><a href='https://www.tjheritage.org/head-heart-letter/' title='Link to My Head and My Heart at www.tjheritage.org' target='_blank'>My Head and My Heart</a>,</em> a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Maria Cosway, October 12, 1786.</blockquote><p>Thomas Jefferson's profile shows only a very slight preference for Thinking over Feeling, and this short passage shows he took advantage of both decision-making techniques.  This explains why some consider him an <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=enigma' title='Link to definition of enigma at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>enigma</a>, in that he could declare <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal' title='Wikipedia page for all men are created equal' target='_blank'>all men are created equal</a></q> while tacitly <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_slavery' title='Wikipedia page for Thomas Jefferson and slavery' target='_blank'>condoning slavery</a>, and even own slaves while <a href='https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/enigma/' title='Link to an article about how Jefferson is an enigma at www.pbs.org' target='_blank'>loving</a> at least one of them.</p><h4>Ugly Rumors</h4><p>Some people claim that Thomas Jefferson and <a href='/image/4900-politicians-founding_fathers/4900/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'>Alexander Hamilton</a> actually <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/david_scott_638754' title='Link to a quote at www.brainyquote.com saying Hamilton and Jefferson hated each other' target='_blank'>hated each other</a>.</q>  Although this is ultimately a matter of <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=semantics' title='Page for the term semantics at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>semantics</a>, one might reasonably like to think the <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/' title='Link to the home page at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> were better than that.</p><p>The following quote, from Jefferson's <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Anas-Thomas-Jefferson/dp/B01DMALMEW' title='Link to The Anas at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Anas</a>, shows he actually had genuine &mdash; albeit qualified &mdash; respect for Hamilton:</p><blockquote>Hamilton was, indeed, a singular character. Of acute understanding, disinterested, honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private life, yet so bewitched and perverted by the British example as to be under thorough conviction that corruption was essential to the government of a nation.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://archive.org/details/completeanastho00sawvgoog' title='Link to his Complete Anas at archive.org' target='_blank'>The Anas</a> by Thomas Jefferson, <a href='http://www.marksquotes.com/Founding-Fathers/Jefferson/index2.htm' title='Link to this quote at www.marksquotes.com' target='_blank'>1791-1806</a>.</blockquote><h4>No Time for Hate</h4><p>Thomas Jefferson's <q>Anas</q> are scraps of paper containing notes he left that, taken together, form a <q><a href='https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/458424?redirect=true' title='Link to an article about The Anas at jamanetwork.com' target='_blank'>well-kept diary</a>.</q>  Jefferson's candid opinion of Hamilton, as expressed above, makes it sound like allegations of <em>hatred</em> might be a bit exaggerated.</p><p>Hate is an emotion, but Jefferson, Hamilton, and Adams were predominantly logical people.  Emotions &mdash; such as those that dominated the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution' title='Wikipedia page for the French Revolution' target='_blank'>French Revolution</a> around this time &mdash; are the driving force behind mobs.</p><p>Although Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Alexander Hamilton became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot' title='Wikipedia page for Riots' target='_blank'>mob violence</a>.  It is actually the <em>lack</em> of hatred and <em>predominance of reason</em> that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.</p><p>Saying the Founding Fathers <q>hated</q> each other sounds shocking because it's <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hyperbole' title='Link to the term hyperbole at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>hyperbole</a> &mdash; essentially <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake+news' title='Link to the term fake news at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>fake news</a> &mdash; at best, a poor choice of words.  If Thomas Jefferson was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a <q>hater,</q> the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.</p><h4>Preserving Liberty</h4><p>Like his fellow Founding Fathers <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5000/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of George Washington on this site'>George Washington</a> and <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5001/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John Adams on this site'>John Adams</a>, Jefferson realized that ignorance would mean the end of the republic:</p><blockquote>Bigotry is the disease of ignorance, of morbid minds; enthusiasm of the free and buoyant. Education & free discussion are the antidotes of both.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson in a letter to John Adams, August 1, 1816.</blockquote><p>Americans are fortunate to have a system of government created by a group of well-educated, reasonable, and sincere <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Founding Fathers' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> such as Thomas Jefferson.

Both of his parents had only recently immigrated to America from Ireland, bringing with them his two older brothers, Hugh (born in 1763) and Robert (born in 1764).</p><h4>Orphan at Fourteen</h4><p>Andrew never met his father, who died in an accident less than a month before he was born.  He then lost his oldest brother Hugh to heatstroke after a battle in the Revolutionary War in June of 1779.</p><p>Still in their teens, Andrew and Robert began serving as a couriers during the Revolutionary War in 1780.  In 1781 the British captured the two, and during their imprisonment Andrew famously <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Andrew-Jackson-disobeys-British-officer-1780.png' title='Wikipedia page for image of Jackson refusing to clean the boots of a British General' target='_blank'>refused to clean a general's boots</a>.</p><p>Andrew's mother was able to get him and Robert released, but she and his brother died of illnesses in 1981.  At 14 years old, Andrew had lost all of his immediate family, and he blamed the British for it.</p><h4><q>Old Hickory</q></h4><p>These early experiences made Andrew Jackson tough, decisive, and loyal to the American dream of liberty and government of the people.</p><blockquote>As long as our government is administered for the good of the people, and is regulated by their will; as long as it secures to us the rights of persons and of property, liberty of conscience, and of the press, it will be worth defending.</blockquote><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812' title='Wikipedia page for the War of 1812' target='_blank'>War of 1812</a> &mdash; specifically the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War' title='Wikipedia page for the Creek War' target='_blank'>Creek War</a> &mdash; this toughness led his men to call him <q>Old Hickory.</q>  His courage in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans' title='Wikipedia page for Battle of New Orleans' target='_blank'>Battle of New Orleans</a> made him a national hero.  These experiences also made him a realist:</p><blockquote>But you must remember, my fellow-citizens, that eternal vigilance by the people is the price of liberty, and that you must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing.</blockquote><p>Jackson could be incredibly cruel, as when he signed the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act' title='Wikipedia page for the Indian Removal Act' target='_blank'>Indian Removal Act</a>.  He could also be very warm, as the following quote reveals:</p><blockquote>Heaven will be no heaven to me if I do not meet my wife there.</blockquote><h4>Extreme Decisiveness</h4><p>Andrew Jackson's all-or-nothing decisiveness is plainly visible in the large amounts of Green and Red in his spiritual portrait, and the Yellow represents is realism.</p><hr /><p>The personality profile for this image is based on the video <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1471325/?ref_=nv_sr_5' title='Page for Andrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Andrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency</a>, which is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGfxyeuy8u8' title='Video of Andrew Jackson: Good, Evil and the Presidency on youtube.com' target='_blank'>available on youtube</a>.</p>",

Although it can be interesting to speculate what type historical characters were, it's important to realize that ultimately this is all purely speculation &mdash; especially when it comes to Introverts.</p><h4>Clearly an Introvert</h4><p>It's clear to me he was an Introvert.  Time and again historians have remarked he liked to be alone to reflect on things and could be <q>hard to read.</q></p><blockquote>He felt he was at his best when he was alone.  He liked to think through things.  He liked quiet time.<br /> - Donald L. Miller, Historian</blockquote><h4>Seeing Both the <q>Forest</q> and the <q>Trees</q></h4><p>Although failing to immediately notice certain facts can quickly get a soldier in trouble, a general who can see both the <q>forest</q> and the <q>trees</q> is in a better position than his peers who can't see the <q>big picture.</q></p><blockquote>A general who can ride around the battlefield, and by glimpsing: men advancing over there, troops forming up over here, artillery firing somewhere in the distance, and can put all of these pieces together in his head, and see what is actually happening, through the smoke, that is a General who has an extraordinary gift.<br /> - Geoffrey Perret, Biographer</blockquote><p>Along with an attention to detail, Grant certainly had his ideals.  Before the war, he set a slave free rather than sell him, and after the war he wanted nothing more than to find peace with the plains indians and stubborn racist southerners.  But this does not mean he had his <q>head in the clouds:</q></p><h4>Keeping It Real</h4><p>Later in life, Grant became friends with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain' title='Wikipedia page for Mark Twain' target='_blank'>Mark Twain</a>, who helped him publish his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Memoirs_of_Ulysses_S._Grant' title='Wikipedia page for ' target='_blank'>personal memoirs</a> shortly after Grant's death in 1885.  </p><blockquote>Having lunch with Grant is like having pork and beans with Julius Ceasar.<br />- Mark Twain</blockquote><p>Twain's quote makes me wish we had time machines and could visit with people who are no longer with us.  Rather than long for things we will never have, it's probably best to just be grateful for the next best thing: having videos such as this one that we can watch!</p><hr /><p>This profile of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant' title='Wikipedia page for Ulysses S.
