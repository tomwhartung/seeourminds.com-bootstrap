Although it can be interesting to speculate what type historical characters were, it's important to realize that ultimately it is purely speculation.</p><p>It's clear to me that he was an Introvert.  Time and again historians in the video mention how he liked to be alone to reflect on things and could be <q>hard to read.</q></p><blockquote>He felt he was at his best when he was alone.  He liked to think through things.  He liked quiet time.<br /> - Donald L. Miller, Historian</blockquote><p>Although failing to immediately notice certain facts can quickly get a soldier in trouble, a general who can see both the <q>forest</q> and the <q>trees</q> is in a better position than his peers who can't see the <q>big picture.</q></p><blockquote>A general who can ride around the battlefield, and by glimpsing: men advancing over there, troops forming up over here, artillery firing somewhere in the distance, and can put all of these pieces together in his head, and see what is actually happening, through the smoke, that is a General who has an extraordinary gift.<br /> - Geoffrey Perret, Biographer</blockquote><p>Indeed, Grant certainly had ideals.  Before the war, he set a slave free rather than sell him, and after the war he wanted nothing more than to find peace with the plains indians and stubborn racist southerners.  But this does not mean he had his <q>head in the clouds:</q></p><blockquote>Having lunch with Grant is like having pork and beans with Julius Ceasar.<br />- Mark Twain</blockquote><p>Twain's quote makes me wish we had time machines and could visit with people who are no longer with us.  Rather than long for things we will never have, it's probably best to just be grateful for the next best thing: having videos such as this one that we can watch!</p>",
