Like his siblings, he grows up quickly after the death of his parents.</p><p>Bran enjoys climbing, but one day he falls from a tower, lands on his back, and ends up crippled for life.  It turns out, however, that he is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warg#Other_works' title='Wikipedia page for warg, cued to the section about other works, which includes, at the very end, a reference to the use of the term by George R. R. Martin in the Game of Thrones novels and show' target='_blank'>warg</a> &mdash; someone whose spirit can inhabit other animals and even people.</p><h4>Bran's World of Ideas</h4><p>The Blue in Bran's spiritual portrait represents his fairly strong preference for ideas over facts.  Given that the fall has left him crippled for the rest of his life, it's easy to see how he would have this preference.</p><p>Once Bran wakes up from the coma induced by the fall, his dreams &mdash; Bran's new world of ideas &mdash; become more and more vivid, eventually becoming visions.  At one point, when some mutinous former members of the <a href='http://iceandfire.wikia.com/wiki/Night%27s_Watch' title='Link to a page about Nights Watch at iceandfire.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Night's Watch</a> are keeping him, Meera, and Jogen prisoners at <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Craster%27s_Keep' title='Link to a page about Crasters Keep at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Craster's Keep</a>, he realizes Jogen has visions similar to his.</p><blockquote>Jogen: [To Brandon.]  You mustn't let anything stop you.<br />Brandon Stark: [Looks at his hands, which are tied up.]  They already have stopped me.<br />Jogen: No.  You're not here.  You're far from here.<br />Meera: What does that mean?<br />Jogen: At the hill.  A great Weirwood tree.<br />Brandon: [Smiles knowingly.]  You've seen it, too.  [A Weirwood tree on a hill appears in behind him.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060856/' title='Page for the episode First of His Name on imdb.com' target='_blank'>First of His Name</a>, Season 4, Episode 5 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2014).</blockquote><p>As he, Meera, and Jogen get closer to finding the tree in their visions, Bran begins to gain more control over his visions and his ability to warg.  He learns how to completely control his ability to see things through his direwolf <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Summer' title='Link to a page about Summer at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Summer</a>'s eyes, and is even able to <q>enter </q> <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Hodor' title='Link to a page about Hodor at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Hodor</a>'s mind and control his actions when they get in trouble.</p><h4>Under the Weirwood Tree</h4><p>They eventually find the <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Weirwood' title='Link to a page about Weirwood tree at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Weirwood tree</a>, and meet a character known as the <q><a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Three-Eyed_Raven' title='Link to a page about Three-Eyed Raven at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Three-Eyed Raven</a>,</q> who lives in a <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Cave_of_the_Three-Eyed_Raven' title='Link to a page about the Cave of the Three-Eyed Raven at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>cave</a> under it, entwined in the Weirwood tree's roots.  Under his tutelage, Bran learns even more about how to control his visions, and eventually Bran learns <q>everything.</q></p><p>During this time, Bran's preference for ideas starts to turn into a dangerous obsession.</p><blockquote>[The Three-eyed Raven halts Bran Stark's pursuit of his father Ned in a vision, causing him to <q>wake up.</q>]<br />Bran Stark: [Inhales deeply.] Why did you do that?  Take me back there.  I want to go back.<br />Three-eyed Raven: No.<br />Bran: He heard me.<br />Three-eyed Raven: Maybe.  Maybe he heard the wind.<br />Bran: He heard me.<br />Three-eyed Raven: The past is already written.  The ink is dry.<br />Bran: What's in that tower?  I want to go back there.<br />Three-eyed Raven: I've told you many times, stay too long where you don't belong and you will never return.<br />Bran: Why do I want to return?  So I can be a cripple again?  So I can talk to an old man in a tree?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4131606/' title='Page for the episode Oathbreaker on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Oathbreaker</a>, Season 6, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2016).</blockquote><p>Bran's openness to new ideas and experiences &mdash; visible as the Blue and Yellow in his spiritual portrait &mdash; borders on recklessness.  His carelessness with regards to the risks he so heartily embraces, which was formerly manifested in his determination to climb the walls of Winterfell higher than is safe, is now fueling his desire to stay in his world of ideas longer than is safe.</p><h4>Bran's Head Rules His Heart</h4><p>Bran's preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; is evident in a crucial moment when his half-brother <a href='/image/2050-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-5/2050/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Jon Snow on this site'>Jon Snow</a> shows up to take care of the mutineers who hold Bran and his friends prisoner at Craster's Keep.</p><blockquote>Bran: [Sees his brother fighting fairly close by.]  Jon!<br />Jogen: If he sees you he won't let you go north.<br />Bran: He's my brother.<br />Jogen: And wants to protect you.  He'll take you back to Castle Black.  You have to decide.  Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?<br />Bran: Hodor.<br />Hodor: Hodor.<br />Bran: We need to free Summer, and we need to go.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3060856/' title='Page for the Game of Thrones episode entitled First of His Name on imdb.com' target='_blank'>First of His Name</a>, Season 4, Episode 5 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2014).</blockquote><p>Thanks to Jogen's understanding and foresight &mdash; it's reasonable to expect that since he and Bran have similar abilities, they may also have similar personalities &mdash; Bran is able to see he needs to stay focused on the big picture.  Because, as everyone knows, <q><a href='https://winteriscoming.net/' title='Link to the home page at winteriscoming.net' target='_blank'>Winter is Coming</a>.</q></p><h4>Cold Winters &mdash; and Cold People</h4><p>As is the case with so many characters on Game of Thrones, Bran's rationality often manifests more as cold, indifferent, objectivity &mdash; <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYiaT6CsSaM' title='Video of No Feelings, performed live at Brixton Academy in 2007 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>No Feelings</a></q> &mdash; when dealing with others rather than as any sort of superior ability in math, science, or the like &#x263A.</p><p>One example of Bran's objectivity appears in the way he awkwardly and tersely thanks Meera for her help, without even mentioning Hodor's and her brother Jogen's sacrifices, in their quest to find the Weirwood tree of Bran's visions.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><blockquote>Bran Stark: You're leaving.<br />Meera: I don't want to leave you.  But when - when they come, I need to be with my family.  You're safe.  Well, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore.<br />Bran: No, I don't.<br />Meera: That's all you've got to say?<br />Bran: Thank you.<br />Meera: <q>Thank you?</q><br />Bran: For helping me.<br />Meera: My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran &mdash;<br />Bran: I'm not, really.  Not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Bran Stark.  But I remember so much else now.<br />Meera: [Voice breaking, trying not to cry.]  You died in that cave.  [Leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775846/' title='Page for the episode The Spoils of War on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Spoils of War</a>, Season 7, Episode 4 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).</blockquote><p>And like so many other characters on the show, Bran has strong feelings for members of his immediate family.  The following quote from a conversation with Sansa shows that &mdash; as is so often the case with people who struggle expressing their emotions &mdash; he hasn't quite mastered tactfulness, much less empathy.</p><blockquote>Bran: It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened, to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces now, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the Long Night comes again, I need to be ready.<br />Sansa: How do you know all this?<br />Bran: The Three-Eyed Raven taught me.<br />Sansa: I thought you were the Three-Eyed Raven.<br />Bran: I told you it's difficult to explain.<br />Sansa: [Sighs.] Bran -<br />Bran: <b>I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here, in our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling, just like now.  And you were so beautiful, in your white wedding dress.</b><br />Sansa: [Breathes heavily and looks afraid.] I have to go back inside, Bran.<br />Bran: I'll stay a bit longer.<br />Sansa: [Leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775840/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Queens Justice on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Queen's Justice</a>, Season 7, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).  [<b>Emphasis added.</b>]</blockquote><p>Naturally Sansa is horrified to suddenly learn her younger brother knows what <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbowed,_Unbent,_Unbroken#In_Winterfell' title='Wikipedia page for episode 6 of season 5 of Game of Thrones, which is entitled Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken, cued to the section about what happened in the episode at Winterfell' target='_blank'>transpired once she was married</a> to the sadistic <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Bolton' title='Wikipedia page for Ramsay Bolton' target='_blank'>Ramsay Bolton</a> &mdash; someone so despicable, by the way, that his image will not be appearing on these pages.  It's reasonable to think that if Bran was more sensitive to his sister's emotions, he would have kept that to himself.</p><h4>Bran Is Dead, Long Live Bran</h4><p>Meera's observation that Bran <q>died in that cave</q> is, when seen in the light of other plots in the show, extremely profound.  From the individual <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectionTropes' title='Link to a page about Resurrection tropes at tvtropes.org' target='_blank'>resurrections</a> of <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Jon_Snow' title='Link to a page about Jon Snow at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Jon Snow</a> and <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Beric_Dondarrion' title='Link to a page about Beric Dondarrion at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>Beric Dondarrion</a>, to the mass <a href='https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/35589/history-of-x-is-dead-long-live-x' title='Link to a page about the phrase x is dead, long live x at english.stackexchange.com' target='_blank'>resurrections</a> of <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Wights' title='Link to a page about the wights at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>the wights</a> &mdash; assuming one could actually call their <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Afterlife' title='Page for the term afterlife at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>afterlife</a> a <q><em>life</em></q> &mdash; rebirth is a common theme in the Westeros of Game of Thrones.</p><p>However the aftermath of the <q>death</q> of Bran's childhood identity takes a different form &mdash; it is more of an awakening.  If Bran's new life is a rebirth, then Arya's return from Braavos and Sansa's second chance as Lady of Winterfell &mdash; significantly, without Ramsay &mdash; can be considered rebirths as well.</p><p>Certainly, extrapolating this idea of rebirth to include the reappearance of older, long-dead Starks &mdash; such as Ned, Catelyn, or <a href='/image/2020-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-2-3/2025/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Robb Stark on this site'>Robb</a> &mdash; is futile, because no one likes <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Westphall#The_Tommy_Westphall_Universe_Hypothesis' title='Wikipedia page for Tommy Westphall, cued to the section about The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis' target='_blank'>silly series finales</a>.

Interestingly, Olenna's and Tywin's spiritual portraits show that they have similar personalities &mdash; although <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2046/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Tywin Lannister on this site'>Tywin</a>'s personality is quite a bit more extreme.</p><h4>A Decidedly Logical Matriarch</h4><p>The Green in Olenna's spiritual portrait represents her decisiveness, which is much more on logic rather than emotion.  It is similar to Tywin Lannister's reasoning in that they both put their family &mdash; their house &mdash; above everything else.</p><blockquote>I did unspeakable things to protect my family.  Or watched them being done, on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell, I did.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Olenna Tyrell in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775840/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Queens Justice on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Queen's Justice</a>, Season 7, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).</blockquote><p>It's clear that people like Olenna and Tywin &mdash; and <a href='/image/2050-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-5/2056/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Stannis Baratheon on this site'>Stannis Baratheon</a>, whose image is also very Green &mdash; have <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHiGR0iuTUo' title='Excellent syncing of a live action video with the studio version the song No Feelings by the Sex Pistols on youtube.com' target='_blank'>no feelings for anybody else</a>.</q></p><h4>In Other Words: No Feelings</h4><p>Rather than turn into apathy or self-pity, Olenna's bitterness only increases when Cersei kills her grandchildren and hundreds of others in the <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Great_Sept_of_Baelor' title='Link to a page about the Destruction of the Sept of Baelor at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>destruction of the Sept of Baelor</a>.  Ultimately she &mdash; like so many who <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR3fD5YyN3g' title='Video of Cersei defining how to play the Game of Thrones on youtube.com' target='_blank'>play the Game of Thrones</a>, she is left only with a desire for vengence.</p><blockquote>Olenna Tyrell: The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated.  A hundred red scorpions, was it?<br />Ellaria Sand: You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna.<br />Olenna: You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?<br />Obara Sand: We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help.  You came to Dorne because you needed our help.<br />Olenna: What is your name again?  Barbaro?<br />Obara: Obara.<br />Olenna: Obara.  [Nods and smiles.]  You look like an angry little boy.  Don't presume to tell me what I need.<br />Nymeria Sand: Forgive my sister.  What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes &mdash;<br />Olenna: Do shut up dear.  [Looks at Tyene.]  Anything from you?  [Gives her no chance to respond.]  No?  Good.  Let the grown women speak.<br />Ellaria: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell.  They have declared war on Dorne.  We must be allies now if we wish to survive.<br />Olenna: Cersei stole the future from me.  She killed my son.  She killed my grandson.  She killed my granddaughter.  Survival is not what I'm after now.<br />Ellaria: You're absolutely right.  I chose the wrong words.  It is not survival I offer.  It is your heart's desire.<br />Olenna: [Smiles wryfully.] And what is my heart's desire?<br />Ellaria: Vengence.

It's what makes it possible to wake up day after day when everything seems lost.</p><h4>Pragmatic Perceptions</h4><p>The Yellow in Olenna's spiritual portrait represents her pragmatism.  Although having no feelings for people other than her family is a prerequisite for her self-centeredness, her pragmatism provides the basis for it.</p><blockquote>Kevan Lannister: If it doesn't go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in this city.  We'll have civil war.  Many will die.<br />Olenna Tyrell: Many will die no matter what we do.  Better them than us.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4283016/' title='Page for the Game of Thrones episode entitled Book of the Stranger on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Book of the Stranger</a>, Season 6, Episode 4 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2016).</blockquote><p>In fact, Olenna favors pragmatism so much that she doubts others can see things any differently.  This is evident in a very revealing and highly entertaining conversation she has with the &mdash; <em>presumably</em> religious, in her view &mdash; High Sparrow:</p><blockquote>Olenna Tyrell: Spare me the homilies.  I can smell a fraud from a mile away.<br />High Sparrow: Useful talent.<br />Olenna: I'm here for my grandson and my granddaughter.<br />High Sparrow: Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied.  The Father judges us all.  Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.  If you break his laws, you will be punished.<br />Olenna: Don't you walk away from me.<br />High Sparrow: You don't give commands here, Olenna.<br />Olenna: What is it you want?  Gold?  I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.<br />High Sparrow: [Chuckles.]<br />Olenna: What then?<br />High Sparrow: I imagine this must be strange for you.  Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.  But I'm telling you a simple truth.  I serve the gods.  The gods demand justice.<br />Olenna: How do they communicate their demands?  By raven or horse?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3866846/' title='Page for the episode entitled The Gift on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Gift</a>, Season 5, Episode 7 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2015).</blockquote><p>And indeed, Olenna's presumption of pragmatism in others is fairly accurate.  Although a preference for idealism is evident in the Blue in the spiritual portraits of the <a href='/image/2060-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-6/2066/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of High Sparrow on this site'>High Sparrow</a>, <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2040/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Joffrey on this site'>Joffrey</a>, and the two people with whom she shares the <a href='/gallery/2070-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-7/' title='Link to the gallery of spiritual portraits for Season 7 of Game of Thrones on this site'>Season 7 gallery</a> &mdash; <a href='/image/2070-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-7/2070/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Bran Stark on this site'>Bran Stark</a> and <a href='/image/2070-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-7/2076/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Petyr Baelish on this site'>Petyr Baelish</a> &mdash; it is by and large a fairly rare trait in <a href='http://www.westeros.org/' title='Link to a page about Westeros at www.westeros.org' target='_blank'>Westeros</a>.</p><h4>In the End</h4><p>Ultimately, the most that people who live in a Westeros ruled by Queen Cersei can hope for is a quick and painless death.  As it turns out, Olenna is fortunate to have <a href='/image/2020-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-2-3/2020/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Jamie Lannister on this site'>Jamie Lannister</a> &mdash; whose varied experiences seem to be helping him get <q>in touch with</q> his humanity &mdash; as her executioner.</p><blockquote>Jamie Lannister: I think we're done here.<br />Olenna Tyrell: How will it happen?<br />Jamie: Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.  [Pulls out a small vial, pops the small cork off of it, pours it in a glass of wine, and pushes the glass towards Olenna.]<br />Olenna: Will there be pain?<br />Jamie: No, I made sure of that.<br />Olenna: That's good.  [Takes glass and quickly drinks all the wine in the glass, and sets it down, empty.]  I'd hate to die like your son.  Clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  Must have been horrible for you, as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I had never seen the poison work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me.<br />Jamie: [Hesitates a bit while it sinks in, then leaves.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5775840/' title='Page for the episode of Game of Thrones entitled The Queens Justice on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Queen's Justice</a>, Season 7, Episode 3 of <a href='https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones' title='Link to the home page for the show Game of Thrones at www.hbo.com' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> (2017).</blockquote><p>And so, as the <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/The_Rains_of_Castamere' title='Link to page about the song The Rains of Castamere at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>song</a> goes, another <a href='http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Reyne' title='Link to a page about House Reyne at awoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>house</a> in Westeros meets its end at the hands of the Lannisters.</p><p>Whether the rains still <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3QW8PVyyNM' title='Still video of a three-eyed raven, backed by the song The Rains of Catemere, on youtube.com' target='_blank'>make a sound</a> when there's <q>no one there to hear</q> is a question for the philosophers to answer.

Ultimately the infatuations driving this triangle of unrequited love prove to be fatal, largely due to Petyr's devious machinations.</p><h4>A Man With a Big Idea</h4><p>The Blue in Petyr Baelish's spiritual portrait shows he has a fairly strong preference for ideas over facts.  This preference is quite obvious in a conversation he has with <a href='/image/2050-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-5/2052/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Cersei Lannister on this site'>Cersei Lannister</a> about her father <a href='/image/2040-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-4/2046/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Tywin Lannister on this site'>Tywin</a> before the midpoint of the series:</p><blockquote>Cersei Lannister: My father's a practical man.

In a conversation with Varys he makes it clear he has a single, highly specific ambition:</p><blockquote>Chaos isn't a pit.  Chaos is a ladder.  Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.  The fall breaks them.  And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse.  They cling to the realm or the Gods or love.  Illusions.

Like all the other <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Player' title='Page for the term player at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>players</a>, Petyr ultimately learns that, as Cersei so <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QR3fD5YyN3g' title='Six-second video of the famous quote by Cersei, that serves as the shows namesake, on youtube.com' target='_blank'>famously said</a>, <q>when you play the game of thrones, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Win_or_You_Die' title='Wikipedia page for you win or you die' target='_blank'>you win or you die</a>.</q></p><h4>Baelish's Rationality</h4><p>While the Blue in Petyr Baelish's spiritual portrait shows he has the ability to strategize, the Green in his image represents his ability to logically devise specific tactics for obtaining his goal.</p><p>Lord Baelish reveals his knack for recognizing the power of advantageous situations in a conversation he has with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sansa_Stark' title='Wikipedia page for Sansa Stark' target='_blank'>Sansa Stark</a> when he escorts her to <a href='http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/The_Eyrie' title='Link to a page about the Eyrie at gameofthrones.wikia.com' target='_blank'>the Eyrie</a>.</p><blockquote>If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

With a cast containing many characters who prefer logic to emotion, this may well be the first real use of mathematics on the show.</p><p>More significantly, it's quite clear he believes he can combine his intelligence with a proclivity for devious acts to become the equal of &mdash; and, in his dreams, perhaps even superior to &mdash; the <a href='http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php?/topic/139758-what-is-considered-highborn/' title='Link to a page about the high-born of Westeros at asoiaf.westeros.org' target='_blank'>high-born</a> of Westeros.</p><h4>Petyr the Player</h4><p>Petyr's devious machinations help him advance, but only up to a point.

In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe.  [Hands him the scabard for the dagger.]  To go through all of that and make your way home again, only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine -<br />Bran: Chaos is a ladder.

However, both scenes are excellent and well worth re-watching several times.</p><p>If anything, though, most people would surely agree that seeing Baelish meet his demise is more satisfying than seeing Olenna's final moments.
