The nature of his programming becomes clear in a scene in which his head is attached to a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/battle-droid' title='Link to a page about battle droids at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>battle droid</a>'s body and he's expected to fight:</p><blockquote>What's all this noise?

Because most droids are presumably programmed to be logical, the spiritual portraits of most of them would certainly contain more Green, and hence look more like that image of the cool-headed R2-D2, and less like this warm image of C-3PO.</p><h4>Communication Difficulties</h4><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at ' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a> contains a chapter about the psychology of the droids on Star Wars.  It observes that some people, such as Luke and Anakin Skywalker, treat the droids with respect, while others, such as Han Solo and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, are rude to them.</p><p>While everyone can understand C-3PO, the book notes how some people, including Luke and Anakin, can understand R2-D2's machine language &mdash; his bleeps, blurps, whistles, and raspberries.  Their ability to communicate with R2-D2 may correlate with their willingness to show kindness to not just him but other droids as well.</p><p>While communication difficulties can certainly fuel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoBLxSElJE&t=19s' title='Video of the dance Heretic performed by Martha Graham and her troupe in 1929 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>prejudices</a>, the negative attitude of people like Han and Obi-Wan towards droids could also have a basis in fear.  There are several <a href='http://common-phobias.com/' title='Link to the home page at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>phobias </a> related to droids, notably <a href='http://common-phobias.com/techno/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about technophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>technophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of technology, <a href='http://www.robots-and-androids.com/Robophobia.html' title='Link to a page about robophobia at www.robots-and-androids.com' target='_blank'>robophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of robots, and <a href='http://common-phobias.com/Cyber/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about cyberphobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>cyberphobia</a> or <q><a href='http://common-phobias.com/logizomechano/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about logizomechanophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>logizomechanophobia</a></q> &ndash; the fear of computers.</p> <h4>Conclusion</h4> <p><em>[It is interesting that, although he has been programmed and is presumably logical, C-3PO shows precious little rationality.]</em></p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at ' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.

It observes that some people, such as Luke and Anakin Skywalker, treat the droids with respect, while others, such as Han Solo and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, are rude to them.</p><p>The book goes on to note how some people, including Luke and Anakin, can understand R2-D2's machine language &mdash; his bleeps, blurps, whistles, and raspberries.  Their ability to communicate with R2-D2 may correlate with their willingness to show kindness to not just him but other droids as well.</p><p>While communication difficulties can certainly fuel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoBLxSElJE&t=19s' title='Video of the dance Heretic performed by Martha Graham and her troupe in 1929 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>prejudices</a>, the negative attitude of people like Han and Obi-Wan towards droids could also have a basis in fear.  There are several <a href='http://common-phobias.com/' title='Link to the home page at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>phobias </a> related to droids, notably <a href='http://common-phobias.com/techno/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about technophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>technophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of technology, <a href='http://www.robots-and-androids.com/Robophobia.html' title='Link to a page about robophobia at www.robots-and-androids.com' target='_blank'>robophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of robots, and <a href='http://common-phobias.com/Cyber/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about cyberphobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>cyberphobia</a> or <q><a href='http://common-phobias.com/logizomechano/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about logizomechanophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>logizomechanophobia</a></q> &ndash; the fear of computers.</p> <hr /><h4>It's Our Lot</h4> <p> </p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p>Will there come a day when droids need an Emancipation Proclimation or a group like PETA to stand up for them?  </p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at ' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
