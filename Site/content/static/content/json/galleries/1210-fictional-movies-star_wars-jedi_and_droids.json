The Sith Lords' portraits lack the Blue of the Jedi's &mdash; they have lost their idealistic view of the Force, and see it only as a means to personal power.</p><h4>Good and Evil: Not Just a Point of View</h4><p>In <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a> Darth Sidious tells Anakin Skywalker that <q>Good is a point of view.</q>  Using lies like this, Sidious successfully seduces Anakin to the dark side, and Anakin becomes Darth Vader.</p><p>Darth Sidious and Darth Vader go on to create a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star' title='Link to a page about the Death Star at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Death Star</a> and use it in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV, A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV, A New Hope</a> to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Disaster' title='Wookieepedia page for the destruction of Alderaan' target='_blank'>destroy Alderaan</a>, a totally peaceful planet &mdash; all to serve their lust for power.</p><p>In contrast, the Jedi have ideals, such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle' title='Wikipedia page for the principle of non-agression' target='_blank'>principle of non-agression</a>.  As Yoda teaches Luke on Dagobah in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>:</p><blockquote>Luke: How am I to know the good side from the bad?<br />Yoda: You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive.  A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never attack.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>It is clear the Sith's death star is not for defense, but for attacking others and even destroying entire planets.  In choosing the dark side and destroying a peaceful planet, the Sith Lords show their contempt for Jedi ideals and the Jedi <q>point of view.</q></p><h4>Idealism Does Not Imply Virtue</h4><p>It is important to realize that, while the idealism of the Jedi correlates to respect for others in the Star Wars universe, this is not necessarily true everywhere.  Just because someone is idealistic does not mean they are virtuous and treat other people with kindness and respect.</p><p>Most importantly, whether someone is good is not a matter of whether they are idealistic, but rather it depends on the nature of their ideals &mdash; and even more so on how they actually treat other people.</p><p>Moreover, regardless of Anakin's psychological preferences and the content of his spiritual portrait, he proved Luke was right when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOQI-LAEzM' title='Video of Darth Vader aka. Anakin killing Palpatine aka.

The Sith Lords' portraits lack the Blue of the Jedi's &mdash; they have lost their idealistic view of the Force, and see it only as a means to personal power.</p><h4>Good and Evil: Not Just a Point of View</h4><p>In <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121766/' title='Page for Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith</a> Darth Sidious tells Anakin Skywalker that <q>Good is a point of view.</q>  Using lies like this, Sidious successfully seduces Anakin to the dark side, and Anakin becomes Darth Vader.</p><p>Darth Sidious and Darth Vader go on to create a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/death-star' title='Link to a page about the Death Star at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Death Star</a> and use it in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV, A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV, A New Hope</a> to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Disaster' title='Wookieepedia page for the destruction of Alderaan' target='_blank'>destroy Alderaan</a>, a totally peaceful planet &mdash; all to serve their lust for power.</p><p>In contrast, the Jedi have ideals, such as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-aggression_principle' title='Wikipedia page for the principle of non-agression' target='_blank'>principle of non-agression</a>.  As Yoda teaches Luke on Dagobah in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>:</p><blockquote>Luke: How am I to know the good side from the bad?<br />Yoda: You will know when you are calm, at peace, passive.

In choosing the dark side and destroying a peaceful planet, the Sith Lords show their contempt for Jedi ideals and the Jedi <q>point of view.</q></p><h4>Idealism Does Not Imply Virtue</h4><p>It is important to realize that, while the idealism of the Jedi correlates to respect for others in the Star Wars universe, this is not necessarily true everywhere.  Just because someone is idealistic does not mean they are virtuous and treat other people with kindness and respect.</p><p>Most importantly, whether someone is good is not a matter of whether they are idealistic, but rather it depends on the nature of their ideals &mdash; and even more so on how they actually treat other people.</p><p>Moreover, regardless of Anakin's psychological preferences and the content of his spiritual portrait, he proved Luke was right when he <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOQI-LAEzM' title='Video of Darth Vader aka.

And so, having gone through the process of analyzing, drawing, and presenting C-3PO's portrait, the result appears above.</p><h4>Three Fifths of a Person?</h4><p>The droids on Star Wars may not be able to taste or smell, but they can certainly see and hear.  And based on one poor <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GNK-series_power_droid' title='Wookieepedia page for the GNK-series power droid' target='_blank'>power droid</a>'s screams while being <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O0-dCLFadQ' title='Video of Gonk being tortured on youtube.com' target='_blank'>tortured</a> in the droid pool run by the sadistic <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/EV-9D9' title='Wookieepedia page for EV-9D9' target='_blank'>EV-9D9</a>, the sense of touch in at least some of them works as well.</p><p>Whether this makes these droids <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise' title='Wikipedia page for the Three-Fifths Compromise' target='_blank'>three fifths of a person</a> is a question best left to philosophers.  What matters here is, the droids have senses that can perceive &mdash; they can gather data as facts.</p><p>The Yellow in C-3PO's spiritual portrait represents this proclivity for sensing data.  It's conceivable he might have programming enabling him to recognize some types of patterns &mdash; hence his image has a bit of Blue &mdash; but most of what C-3PO takes in is factual, not ideological.</p><h4>Riding an Emotional Rollercoaster</h4><p>C-3PO wears his <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=heart+on+their+sleeve' title='Page for the term heart on their sleeve at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>heart on his sleeve</a> and is constantly sharing his emotions.  In just the first hour of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, C-3PO goes from misery, to bliss, then back to misery again.</p><p>Early in the film C-3PO is terrified as their ship is being boarded by Imperial Stormtroopers.  He searches frantically for his counterpart <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1217/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of R2-D2 on this site'>R2-D2</a>, and when he finally finds him, says:</p><blockquote>At last!  Where have you been?  They're heading in this direction.  What are we going to do?  We'll be sent to the <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/kessel' title='Link to a page about Kessel at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>spice mines of Kessel</a>!  Smashed into who-knows-what!  Wait a minute.

On <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/tatooine' title='Link to a page about Tatooine at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a>, a band of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/jawa' title='Link to a page about Jawas at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Jawas</a> pick up the two droids and <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a> soon purchases C-3PO and R2-D2 from them.  When Luke takes them to their new home, C-3PO is ecstatic about getting an oil bath:</p><blockquote>Thank the maker!

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote><p>Before too long C-3PO is terrified again as he and his new friends escape from Tatooine while under fire from <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Stormtrooper' title='Wookieepedia page for Imperial Stormtroopers' target='_blank'>Imperial Stormtroopers</a>:</p><blockquote>Oh my!

[Emphasis added.]</blockquote><h4>It's Not a Bug, It's a Feature</h4><p>This emotional rollercoaster ride is a result of the programming C-3PO has received as a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/3PO-series_protocol_droid' title='Wookieepedia page for protocol droid' target='_blank'>protocol droid</a>.  The nature of his programming becomes clear in a scene in which his head is attached to a <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/battle-droid' title='Link to a page about battle droids at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>battle droid</a>'s body and he's expected to fight:</p><blockquote>What's all this noise?  A-a battle?  Oh, there's been some terrible mistake!  I'm <b>programmed for etiquette, not destruction!</b><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121765/' title='Page for Episode II: Attack of the Clones on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode II: Attack of the Clones</a>, 2002.  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote><p>The Red in C-3PO's spiritual portrait represents his proclivity for feeling and expressing his emotions.</p><p>3CPO's personality &mdash; and his spiritual portrait &mdash; stand in stark contrast to the <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1217/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of R2-D2 on this site'>portrait</a> of his cool, calm, and collected <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=comrade' title='Page for the term comrade at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>comrade</a> R2-D2.  Because most droids are presumably programmed to be logical, the spiritual portraits of most of them would certainly have more Green &mdash; and look more like the one of R2-D2 &mdash; and look less like this warm, Red image of C-3PO.</p><h4>Communication Difficulties</h4><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a> contains a chapter about the psychology of the droids on Star Wars.  It observes that some people, such as Luke and Anakin Skywalker, treat the droids with respect, while others, such as Han Solo and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, are rude to them.</p><p>C-3PO is skilled at communication, so everyone can understand him.  Other droids, such as his counterpart R2-D2, speak only in machine language &mdash; bleeps, blurps, whistles, and raspberries.</p><p>The book notes how some people, such as Luke and Anakin, can understand this machine language.  It speculates, quite reasonably, that the ability of people like Luke and Anakin to communicate with R2-D2 may correlate with their willingness to be kind to not just him but other droids as well.</p><p>While communication difficulties can certainly fuel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoBLxSElJE&t=19s' title='Video of the dance Heretic performed by Martha Graham and her troupe in 1929 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>prejudices</a>, the negative attitude towards droids harbored by people like Han and Obi-Wan could also have a basis in fear.  There are several <a href='http://common-phobias.com/' title='Link to the home page at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>phobias </a> related to droids, notably <a href='http://common-phobias.com/techno/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about technophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>technophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of technology, <a href='http://www.robots-and-androids.com/Robophobia.html' title='Link to a page about robophobia at www.robots-and-androids.com' target='_blank'>robophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of robots, and <a href='http://common-phobias.com/Cyber/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about cyberphobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>cyberphobia</a> or <q><a href='http://common-phobias.com/logizomechano/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about logizomechanophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>logizomechanophobia</a></q> &ndash; the fear of computers.</p><h4><q>It's Our Lot</q></h4><p>Some people may show droids kindness and respect, but who can know for sure if &mdash; much less how &mdash; they feel?  Moreover, the brutal truth of the matter is, droids are second-class citizens at best, and slaves at worst.</p><p>Does that sound unpleasantly familiar?  The phrase <a href='http://www.blackpast.org/aah/three-fifths-clause-united-states-constitution-1787' title='Link to a page about three-fifths clause of the United States Constitution at www.blackpast.org' target='_blank'>three-fifths of a person </a>certainly has a nasty ring to it!</p><p>In a scene from the first ten minutes of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, C-3PO expresses his pragmatic take on his woeful social status as he and his counterpart R2-D2 leave an escape pod and venture out into the desert on Tatooine:</p><blockquote>How did we get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=2nuSnE6GNdo' title='Short video of C-3PO saying this on youtube.com' target='_blank'>We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.</a><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO, in A New Hope, 1977.</blockquote><h4>E-Person, E-Servant, or Just Plain Slave?</h4><p>Will there come a day when droids need a group like <a href='https://www.peta.org/' title='Link to the home page at www.peta.org' target='_blank'>PETA</a> to stand up for them, or an <a href='https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation' title='Link to a page about the Emancipation Proclimation at www.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Emancipation Proclimation</a> to allow them to choose their own destiny &mdash; perhaps allowing them to choose between having to obey the <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/rebel-alliance' title='Link to a page about the Rebel Alliance at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a> or the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a>?</p><p>Today those ideas seem unlikely, even silly &mdash; but as they like to say, <a href='https://www.finsif.fi/should-robots-be-electronic-persons-or-slaves/' title='Link to an article about whether robots should be electronic persons or slaves at www.finsif.fi' target='_blank'>history repeats itself</a>.</p><p>Certainly it would be safest to just treat <a href='https://www.amazon.com/meet-alexa/b?ie=UTF8&node=16067214011' title='Link to a page about Alexa at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Alexa</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cortana' title='Link to a page about Cortana at www.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>Cortana</a>, <a href='https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/' title='Link to a page about Siri at www.apple.com' target='_blank'>Siri</a>, and all future <a href='https://www.techopedia.com/definition/190/artificial-intelligence-ai' title='Link to a page about AIs at www.techopedia.com' target='_blank'>AIs</a> with respect, just in case.

And so, having gone through the process of analyzing, drawing, and presenting R2-D2's portrait, the result appears above.</p><h4>Three Fifths of a Person?</h4><p>The droids on Star Wars may not be able to taste or smell, but they can certainly see and hear.  And based on one poor <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/GNK-series_power_droid' title='Wookieepedia page for the GNK-series power droid' target='_blank'>power droid</a>'s screams while being <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O0-dCLFadQ' title='Video of Gonk being tortured on youtube.com' target='_blank'>tortured</a> in the droid pool run by the sadistic <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/EV-9D9' title='Wookieepedia page for EV-9D9' target='_blank'>EV-9D9</a>, the sense of touch in at least some of them works as well.</p><p>Whether this makes these droids <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise' title='Wikipedia page for the Three-Fifths Compromise' target='_blank'>three fifths of a person</a> is a question best left to philosophers.  What matters here is, the droids have senses that can perceive &mdash; they can gather data as facts.</p><p>The Yellow in R2-D2's spiritual portrait represents this proclivity for sensing data.  It's conceivable he might have programming enabling him to recognize some types of patterns &mdash; hence his image has a bit of Blue &mdash; but most of what R2-D2 takes in is factual, not ideological.</p><h4>Keep Calm and Trust R2-D2</h4><p>R2-D2 shows his <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=mettle' title='Page for the term mettle at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>mettle</a> in a <a href='http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaceAgainstTheClock' title='Link to a page about race-against-the-clock scenes at tvtropes.org' target='_blank'>race-against-the-clock scene</a> in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>.  When <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a>, <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1206' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Han Solo on this site'>Han Solo</a>, and Chewbacca go to rescue <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1203' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Princess Leia on this site'>Princess Leia</a> aboard an Imperial Cruiser, they end up being slowly <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U3Oti2L8S4' title='Video of this scene on youtube.com' target='_blank'>crushed</a> in <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Garbage_Compactor_3263827' title='Link to a page about garbage compactor 3263287 at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>garbage compactor 3263287</a>.</p><p>Everyone else &mdash; even his counterpart <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1215/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of C-3PO on this site'>C-3PO</a> &mdash; panics, but R2-D2 calmly saves the day by disabling all of the compactors on that level.  While R2-D2 occassionally expresses beeps and whistles that may betray emotion, he proves in this scene he can keep cool and solve problems under pressure.</p><p>The Green in R2-D2's spiritual portrait represents his ability to keep calm and his proclivity to use logic and his specialized abilities to solve problems, while ignoring any emotions he might feel.</p><p>R2-D2's personality &mdash; and his spiritual portrait &mdash; stand in stark contrast to the <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1215/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of C-3PO on this site'>portrait</a> of his emotional-roller-coaster-riding <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=comrade' title='Page for the term comrade at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>comrade</a> C-3PO.  Because most droids are presumably programmed to be logical, the spiritual portraits of most of them would certainly have more Green &mdash; and look more like this one of R2-D2 &mdash; and look less like the warm, Red image of the emotional C-3PO.</p><h4>Communication Difficulties</h4><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a> contains a chapter about the psychology of the droids on Star Wars.  It observes that some people, such as Luke and Anakin Skywalker, treat the droids with respect, while others, such as Han Solo and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, are rude to them.</p><p>R2-D2 speaks only in machine language — bleeps, blurps, whistles, and raspberries.  For communication with most humans, R2-D2 is dependent on a protocol droid like his counterpart C-3PO, whose specialty is communication.</p><p>The book notes how some people, such as Luke and Anakin, can understand this machine language.  It speculates, quite reasonably, that the ability of people like Luke and Anakin to communicate with R2-D2 may correlate with their willingness to be kind to not just him but other droids as well.</p><p>While communication difficulties can certainly fuel <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaoBLxSElJE&t=19s' title='Video of the dance Heretic performed by Martha Graham and her troupe in 1929 on youtube.com' target='_blank'>prejudices</a>, the negative attitude towards droids harbored by people like Han and Obi-Wan could also have a basis in fear.  There are several <a href='http://common-phobias.com/' title='Link to the home page at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>phobias </a> related to droids, notably <a href='http://common-phobias.com/techno/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about technophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>technophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of technology, <a href='http://www.robots-and-androids.com/Robophobia.html' title='Link to a page about robophobia at www.robots-and-androids.com' target='_blank'>robophobia</a> &ndash; the fear of robots, and <a href='http://common-phobias.com/Cyber/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about cyberphobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>cyberphobia</a> or <q><a href='http://common-phobias.com/logizomechano/phobia.htm' title='Link to a page about logizomechanophobia at common-phobias.com' target='_blank'>logizomechanophobia</a></q> &ndash; the fear of computers.</p><h4><q>It's Our Lot</q></h4><p>Some people may show droids kindness and respect, but who can know for sure if &mdash; much less how &mdash; they feel?  Moreover, the brutal truth of the matter is, droids are second-class citizens at best, and slaves at worst.</p><p>Does that sound unpleasantly familiar?  The phrase <a href='http://www.blackpast.org/aah/three-fifths-clause-united-states-constitution-1787' title='Link to a page about three-fifths clause of the United States Constitution at www.blackpast.org' target='_blank'>three-fifths of a person </a>certainly has a nasty ring to it!</p><p>In a scene from the first ten minutes of <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, C-3PO expresses his pragmatic take on his woeful social status as he and R2-D2 leave an escape pod and venture out into the desert on Tatooine:</p><blockquote>How did we get into this mess?  I really don't know how.  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=2nuSnE6GNdo' title='Short video of C-3PO saying this on youtube.com' target='_blank'>We seem to be made to suffer.  It's our lot in life.</a><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;C-3PO, in A New Hope, 1977.</blockquote><h4>E-Person, E-Servant, or Just Plain Slave?</h4><p>Will there come a day when droids need a group like <a href='https://www.peta.org/' title='Link to the home page at www.peta.org' target='_blank'>PETA</a> to stand up for them, or an <a href='https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/emancipation-proclamation' title='Link to a page about the Emancipation Proclimation at www.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Emancipation Proclimation</a> to allow them to choose their own destiny &mdash; perhaps allowing them to choose between having to obey the <a href='http://www.starwars.com/databank/rebel-alliance' title='Link to a page about the Rebel Alliance at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a> or the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a>?</p><p>Today those ideas seem unlikely, even silly &mdash; but as they like to say, <a href='https://www.finsif.fi/should-robots-be-electronic-persons-or-slaves/' title='Link to an article about whether robots should be electronic persons or slaves at www.finsif.fi' target='_blank'>history repeats itself</a>.</p><p>Certainly it would be safest to just treat <a href='https://www.amazon.com/meet-alexa/b?ie=UTF8&node=16067214011' title='Link to a page about Alexa at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Alexa</a>, <a href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/cortana' title='Link to a page about Cortana at www.microsoft.com' target='_blank'>Cortana</a>, <a href='https://www.apple.com/ios/siri/' title='Link to a page about Siri at www.apple.com' target='_blank'>Siri</a>, and all future <a href='https://www.techopedia.com/definition/190/artificial-intelligence-ai' title='Link to a page about AIs at www.techopedia.com' target='_blank'>AIs</a> with respect, just in case.  After all, kindness takes very little effort when it's habitual.</p><hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the first six <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page' title='Main Wookieepedia page for Star Wars' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a> movies, both the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Original_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the original trilogy' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a> (1977-1980) and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Wookieepedia page for the prequel trilogy' target='_blank'>prequel trilogy</a> (1999-2005).</p><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.  This excellent book is a collection of immensely entertaining and enlightening essays and if you are a fan of <a href='http://www.starwars.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.starwars.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars</a>, I recommend it highly!</p>",
