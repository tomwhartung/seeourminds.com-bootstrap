The Blue shows that both Jedis prefer ideas to facts, and the Green shows they are much more rational than emotional.</p><p>In contrast, the spiritual portraits of the two droids look very different.  The Yellow in both images shows that both are pragmatic, but that is where the similarities end.</p><p>The Red in C-3PO's image shows he is extremely emotional, and the long Yellow vertical line shows he's more out-going.  Meanwhile, the Green in R2-D2's portrait shows he is extremely rational, and the long horizontal Green line indicates he's more of a listener.</p><p>To learn more about a character's personality, click on their thumbnail to see a larger version, then click on the <b>Show the Whole Story</b> button to read the character's story.</p>",
