  "story_html": "<p>The spiritual portraits of the two Jedis look very similar.  The Blue shows that both Yoda and Obi-Wan prefer ideas to facts, and the Green shows they are much more rational than emotional.</p><p>In contrast, the spiritual portraits of the two droids look very different.  The Yellow shows that both are pragmatic, but C-3PO's image shows he is out-going and the Red shows he has a lot of emotion.  Meanwhile R2-D2's portrait shows he's more withdrawn and the Green shows he is extremely rational.</p><p>To learn more about a character's personality, click on their thumbnail to see a larger version, then click on the <b>Show the Whole Story</b> button to read the character's story.</p>",
