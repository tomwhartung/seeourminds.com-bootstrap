  "description_html": "<p>These images of Councilman Tommy Carcetti and his advisor Theresa D'Agostino show they have similar personalities, and that Theresa is much more logical and decisive than Tommy.  Their shared preferences for logic and ideas make them excellent strategists.</p><p>Carcetti was wise to pick Norman as his advisor, because they are opposites.  Tommy pays Norman to critique his strategies, using Norman as a sanity check before taking action.</p><p>The spiritual portrait of Clay Davis shows he is warm and pragmatic, just like Norman, but much more decisive and outgoing.</p>",
