When I started grad school I took some electronic music classes with Dr. Carrier.  As a former Assembly language programmer for NASA, he knew a great deal about the digital world, but valued his analog stereo equipment (yes I am talking not just vinyl but TUBES, people) a great deal.  I suppose one could call him \"eccentric,\" and the large amount of blue in his image attests to that."

The original version of this site (written in Lisp for an old 8088-based PC) wound up being the final project for a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies degree.  Walter Wright was my academic advisor for this degree."
