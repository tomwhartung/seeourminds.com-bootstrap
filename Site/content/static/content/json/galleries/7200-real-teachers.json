Unfortunately I did not get any images of those teachers.</p><p>To be honest, I was concerned that asking them to answer the questionnaire so I could draw their image was somehow not serious enough for them.  The <a href='http://arts.vcu.edu' title='Link to the page for the Art department at vcu.edu' target='_blank'>Art Department</a>, however, was very supportive of my work on this project.</p><p>I worked my way through school, paying for all but the first year or two out of my own pocket.  I changed majors a few times but thoroughly enjoyed all of the many years I spent there.  I will forever be grateful to the faculty and administrators in all these departments for the opportunity they gave me to earn my unique Interdisciplinary Masters Degree!",

The conversion became complete probably about the time I read Point and Line to Plane by Wassily Kandinsky for a Computer Graphic Design class in VCU's Art Department.  The original version of this site (written in Lisp for an old 8088-based PC) wound up being the final project for a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies degree.  Walter Wright was my academic advisor for this degree.",

In Introverts, the dominant function is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long horizontal line to represent this.

In Introverts, the auxiliary function is directed outwardly and is more evident than the dominant function.

When I started grad school I took some electronic music classes with Dr. Carrier.  As a former Assembly language programmer for NASA, he knew a great deal about the digital world, but valued his analog stereo equipment (yes I am talking not just vinyl but TUBES, people) a great deal.  I suppose one could call him \"eccentric,\" and the large amount of blue in his image attests to that.",
