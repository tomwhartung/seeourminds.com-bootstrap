  "description_html": "<p>These spiritual portraits of Twin Peaks characters who work at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Northern_Hotel' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for the Great Northern Hotel' target='_blank'>Great Northern Hotel</a> and the <a href='http://twinpeaks.wikia.com/wiki/Packard_Sawmill' title='Link to the Wikipedia page for Packard Sawmill' target='_blank'>Packard Sawmill</a> show how different Benjamin Horne and Catherine Martell are from Pete Martell and Josie Packard.  Meanwhile, Audrey's personality has the Yellow realism of the first group and the Red amiability of the second.</p>",
  "story_html": "<p>The images make it clear that Benjamin Horne and Catherine Martell have very similar personalities.  Both are very logical, pragmatic, and decisive &mdash; with Catherine's image showing she is just a little bit colder than Ben.</p><p>The portraits also show that Pete Martell's and Josie Packard's personalities are similar to each other &mdash; but the polar opposite of Ben's and Catherine's.  Josie and Pete are both shy, idealistic, sensitive, and perceptive &mdash; with Pete being a bit more outgoing and friendly than Josie, and her being a bit more shy and intuitive.</p>",
