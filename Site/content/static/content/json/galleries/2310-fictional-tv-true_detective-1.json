  "story_html": "<p>The substantial amounts of Green (for <q>T</q>hinking) in both of their portraits represents their no-nonsense approach to their work.  Their different backgrounds and personal lives may interfere from time to time, but the universal appeal of this logic gives them common ground and they share an important goal: to get the bad guys.</p><p>I've thoroughly enjoyed watching both seasons of this show!  Listening to the commentary tracks &mdash; which are excellent in quality &mdash; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nic_Pizzolatto' title='Wikipedia page for Nic Pizzolatto' target='_blank'>Nic Pizzolatto</a> impresses me as a very perceptive individual.
