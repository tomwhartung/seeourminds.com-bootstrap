Ultimately, though, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1y8YSg0wpw' title='Greatest Hit Videos of Cat Stevens on youtube.com' target='_blank'>Cat Stevens</a> was his favorite artist.</p><p>He had a great laugh and was hard-working and smart, but after completing high school, had no interest in furthering his education.  As we grew older and less resilient to the after effects of partying, most of us learned how to abstain or at least moderate.  Eric was one exception to this general trend I saw among my friends and in myself, as we grew into our thirties and beyond.</p><p>At one point he read some <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche' title='Wikipedia page for Friedrich Nietzsche' target='_blank'>Nietzsche</a>.  This seemed to fuel his drinking and make him more apathetic about life in general and the future in particular.  Ultimately he became a very <a href='https://sceneclip.com/clip/ecNgc8g' title='Link to mp4 of tragic figure line on The Sopranos, on sceneclip.com, repeating ad infinitum' target='_blank'>tragic figure</a>.</p><p>Eric <a href='http://www.richmond.com/obituaries/article_3058bb72-ffb0-50fc-af2f-71658714e963.html' title='Obituary for Eric at www.richmond.com' target='_blank'>passed away</a> on November 26, 2016.
