These three images could be considered <q>the good, the bad, and the ugly</q> of ISTPs.</p><p>At the time of this writing, the series is not yet complete.

Why?<br />Jon Snow: It's where she belonged.<br />Ser Davos: Some of the Night's Watch feel you have too too much affection for the wildings.<br />Jon Snow: The were born on the wrong side of the wall.
