In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.

He supplemented the tutoring he received at a private school with reading his family's books.</p><p>Still a teenager, Hamilton came to America in 1772 and, after a year or so, began studying at King's College (now <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_College,_Columbia_University' title='Wikipedia page for Columbia College and Columbia University' target='_blank'>Columbia</a>) in New York City.  He was exposed to and soon joined the patriots' revolutionary cause, and served as one of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%27s_aides-de-camp' title='Wikipedia page for Washingtons aides de camp' target='_blank'>Washington's aides de camp</a> for four years.</p><p>The decisiveness that Alexander Hamilton developed during his youth &mdash; represented by the vast amount of Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; served him well during the war, giving him courage and conviction.  After the war, his strong will and keen reasoning ability led him to pursue a career in law.</p><h4>The Inevitable Push-Back</h4><p>Even as a young man, Hamilton did not find as much satisfaction in his law career.  He became interested in the politics of the new nation, and his father-in-law <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Schuyler' title='Wikipedia page for Philip Schuyler' target='_blank'>Philip Schuyler</a> chose him to represent New York in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Constitutional Convention' target='_blank'>Constitutional Convention</a> in 1787.</p><p>Anyone who has ever been among decisive people, whether it be on a playground or in a board room, can certainly confirm <q>Publius's</q> observation in Federalist No. 70:</p><blockquote>Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Authorship' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers, cued to the section about their Authorship' target='_blank'>Publius</a> in <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-70' title='Link to Federalist No. 70 at www.congress.gov' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 70</a>, <em>The Executive Department Further Considered,</em> March 18, 1788.</blockquote><p>The push-back Hamilton had been experiencing in the war and his work as a lawyer was soon to get worse, driving him to join <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison' title='Wikipedia page for James Madison' target='_blank'>James Madison</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay' title='Wikipedia page for John Jay' target='_blank'>John Jay</a> in writing the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers' target='_blank'>Federalist Papers</a>.</p><p>These publications are sometimes mistakenly thought to be Hamilton's alone, because he initiated and managed the series.  Ultimately Madison wrote 29 and Jay penned just 5, while the decisive and ambitious Alexander wrote 51 of them.</p><h4>Hamilton, the Realist</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton's experiences in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War' title='Wikipedia page for the American Revolutionary War' target='_blank'>Revolutionary War</a> were a driving force behind his desire for a strong <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Federal government of the United States' target='_blank'>Federal Government</a>.  As Washington's aide, he had seen first hand how the lack of essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.</p><p>With <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion' title='Wikipedia page for Shays Rebellion' target='_blank'>Shay's Rebellion</a> in 1786 and 1787, America had already experienced a militant uprising that threatened the lives of law-abiding citizens.  However, in the years following the Revolutionary War the country's standing army was miniscule.  And with no codified way to repay lingering debt for the w,r Hamilton knew it would be very difficult to find new recruits.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton's prevailing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)' title='Wikipedia page for realism in foreign affairs' target='_blank'>realism</a> &mdash; represented by the Yellow in his spiritual portrait &mdash; contrasts quite strongly with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism' title='Wikipedia page for Idealism' target='_blank'>idealism</a> of <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a>.  Where Jefferson, who lived in the Virginia countryside, envisioned a rural, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_society' title='Wikipedia page for agrarian society' target='_blank'>agrarian society</a>, Hamilton, who lived on the island of Manhattan in New York City, foresaw large, bustling cities.</p><p>Hamilton's and Jefferson's different attitudes are especially evident with regards to the idea of a standing army:</p><blockquote>Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be, we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition of others.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Authorship' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers, cued to the section about their Authorship' target='_blank'>Publius</a> in <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-34' title='Link to Federalist No. 34 at ' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 34</a>, <em>The Same Subject Continued: Concerning the General Power of Taxation,</em> January 4, 1788.</blockquote><p>While Jefferson thought the United States could remain neutral without a standing military, Hamilton knew this idea was dangerously unrealistic.</p><h4>Hamilton, the Meta-President</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton was never president.  This is due to a <a href='https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Alexander-Hamilton-run-for-president' title='Link to a number of reasons why Alexander Hamilton was never president at www.quora.com' target='_blank'>number of reasons</a>, including being illegitimate and foreign-born, his relatively young age, and his unfortunate involvement in the infamous <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Reynolds_sex_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Hamilton-Maria Reynolds scandal' target='_blank'>Maria Reynolds scandal</a>.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton could rightly be called a <em><a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=meta' title='Link to the term meta- at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>meta-</a>president,</em> though:</p><ul><li>As a member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Constitutional Convention' target='_blank'>Constitutional Convention</a> he had a role in creating and defining the presidency.</li><li>His <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-70' title='Link to Federalist No. 70 at www.congress.gov' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 70</a>, <em>The Executive Department Further Considered,</em> outlines the specific duties of the president in considerable detail.</li><li>As someone with a considerable amount of pull with the presidential electors, he could make or break candidates in the first few elections.</li></ul><p>No one dared oppose <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1788%E2%80%9389' title='Wikipedia page for the first United States presidential election in 1788-1789' target='_blank'>George Washington</a> in the first two Presidential elections in 1788 and 1792.  So those two terms were a done deal, and to this date, Washington has been the only president who did not belong to a political party.</p><p>However, when Washington refused to run for a third term, Hamilton worked <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1796' title='Wikipedia page for the third United States presidential election in 1796' target='_blank'>behind the scenes</a> to help <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5001' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John Adams on this site' target='_blank'>John Adams</a> get elected in 1796.  Hamilton also helped <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson' title='Wikipedia page for Thomas Jefferson' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson</a> get elected <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1800' target='_blank'>President in 1800</a>.</p><p>While he lived, Alexander Hamilton was more than a president, he was a <em><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta' title='Link to the term meta- at en.wikipedia.org' target='_blank'>meta-</a>president.</em></p><h4>A Complicated Assumption</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton turned his world-class reasoning ability and fine attention to detail into <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=superhero' title='Link to the term superhero at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>superhero</a> powers in the late 1780s, culminating in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for Compromise of 1790' target='_blank'>Compromise of 1790</a>.</p><p>State governments were frequently forced to fund the Revolutionary War with notes that were essentially <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iou.asp' title='Link to page about I.O.U.s at www.investopedia.com' target='_blank'>I.O.U.</a>s.  Some people &mdash; such as farmers who were formerly soldiers and needed to buy seeds, for example &mdash; had sold their notes to <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculator.asp' title='Link to a page about speculators at www.investopedia.com' target='_blank'>speculators</a>, often for mere cents on the dollar.  And some states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, had paid off most of this debt, while other states, such as Massachusetts and South Carolina, had heavy debts left yet to pay.</p><p>Figuring out a way to make everyone happy in this situation was problematic:</p><ul><li>Should the federal government <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_Assumption' title='Wikipedia page for the Assumption of the Revolutionary War Debt' target='_blank'>assume the states' debts</a> &mdash; rewarding the states that still had massive debts at the expense of the more conscientious ones?</li><li>Should the I.O.U.s be paid off at full face value &mdash; rewarding the speculators at the expense of people like the hard-working farmer-soldiers?</li></ul><p>Hamilton believed the answer to both questions was <q>Yes,</q> and as the nation's first <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Secretary of the Treasury' target='_blank'>Secretary of the Treasury</a>, his opinions mattered more than anyone else's.  He set forth the facts and his reasoning about them in the <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-06-02-0076-0002-0001' title='Link to the First Report on the Public Credit at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>First Report on the Public Credit</a>, and delivered the 40,000 word document to Congress on January 9, 1790.</p><h4>More Push-Back</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit' title='Wikipedia page for the First Report on the Public Credit' target='_blank'>Report on the Public Credit</a>, presented to Congress in January of 1790, got a lot of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit#Agrarian_opposition_to_Assumption' title='Wikipedia page for the First Report on the Public Credit, cued to the section entitled Agrarian opposition to Assumption' target='_blank'>push-back</a>.  A stalemate resulted, with House Representative James Madison and Washington's new <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State' title='Wikipedia page describing the position of United States Secretary of State' target='_blank'>Secretary of State</a> Thomas Jefferson leading the opposition.</p><p>Just a few years prior to this, Hamilton had bemoaned the creation of political parties, and the difficulty inherent in trying to change people's opinions, once they've been formed:</p><blockquote>[N]othing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties.  In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselyte' title='Wikipedia page for proselyte' target='_blank'>proselytes</a> by fire and sword.  Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Alexander Hamilton, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Authorship' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers, cued to the section about their Authorship' target='_blank'>Publius</a> in <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-1' title='Link to Federalist No. 1 at www.congress.gov' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 1</a>, <em>General Introduction,</em> October 27, 1787.</blockquote><h4>Dinner Time!</h4><p>The stalemate over assumption ended on June 20, 1790, when Alexander Hamilton sat down to dinner with Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and to discuss the situation.  During this famous conversation, Jefferson and Madison agreed to acquiesce on the assumption of state debts if Hamilton would agree to move the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol#History' title='Wikipedia page for the nation's capitol, cued to the section on its History' target='_blank'>nation's capitol</a> south from its original home in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall' title='Wikipedia page for Federal Hall' target='_blank'>Manhattan</a> &mdash; a city that some of Hamilton's fans actually wanted to call <em><a href='http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/books/reviews/n_10365/index2.html' title='Link to a book review about this topic at nymag.com' target='_blank'>Hamiltonopolis</a></em>.</p><p>With the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Compromise of 1790' target='_blank'>Compromise of 1790</a>, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison agreed to pass legislation that would become known as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_Act_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Funding Act of 1790' target='_blank'>Funding Act of 1790</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act' title='Wikipedia page for Residence Act' target='_blank'>Residence Act</a>.</p><p>The Funding Act called for the assumption of the states' war debts by the Federal Government &mdash; and everything that went along with that.  And the Residence Act called for temporarily moving the nation's capitol from its current home in New York City to <a href='http://www.visitphilly.com/' title='Link to the home page at www.visitphilly.com' target='_blank'>Philadelphia</a>.  From there it would move again to a permanent home in <a href='https://washington.org/' title='Link to the home page at washington.org' target='_blank'>Washington, D.C.</a>, a new city on the Potomac River between Maryland and Virginia.</p><h4>Party Time!</h4><p>A significant side effect of all this was the creation of America's two-party system.  The process started with Jefferson's and Madison's informal <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Administration_party' title='Wikipedia page for Anti-Administration party' target='_blank'>Anti-Administration Party</a> in 1789.</p><p>Two years later, Alexander Hamilton and his supporters formed the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Party' target='_blank'>Federalist Party</a>.  And a year after that the informal Anti-Administration Party evolved into the formal <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party' title='Wikipedia page for the Democratic-Republican Party' target='_blank'>Republican Party</a> &mdash; known to some historians as the <em>Democratic-Republican Party,</em> and not to be confused with today's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the current Republican Party, aka. as the GOP' target='_blank'>GOP</a> &mdash; in 1792.</p><h4>Ugly Rumors</h4><p>Some people claim that Alexander Hamilton and <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a> actually <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/david_scott_638754' title='Link to a quote at www.brainyquote.com saying Hamilton and Jefferson hated each other' target='_blank'>hated each other</a>.</q>  Although this is ultimately a matter of <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=semantics' title='Page for the term semantics at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>semantics</a>, one might reasonably like to think the <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/' title='Link to the home page at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a> were better than that.</p><p>Indeed, some recent accounts of their relationship <a href='https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/how-hamilton-recasts-thomas-jefferson-as-a-villain/401669/' title='Link to an article asserting that the Hamilton musical casts Jefferson as a villian at www.theatlantic.com' target='_blank'>paint Jefferson as a villain</a>.  However, allegations of <em>hatred</em> are a bit exaggerated.</p><p>In <a href='https://archive.org/details/completeanastho00sawvgoog' title='Link to Thomas Jeffersons Anas at archive.org' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson's Anas</a> he states Alexander Hamilton was <em><q>honest, and honorable in all private transactions, amiable in society, and duly valuing virtue in private.</q></em> This is hardly the language of a <q>hater.</q></p><p>Likewise, when Alexander Hamilton helped Jefferson beat Aaron Burr in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election in 1800' target='_blank'>fourth presidential election</a> in 1800, he showed he had at least some respect for Jefferson.  Again, this does not sound like something a <q>hater</q> would do.</p><h4>No Time for Hate</h4><p>When <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr' title='Wikipedia page for Aaron Burr' target='_blank'>Aaron Burr</a> forced Alexander Hamilton into their <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjsqZHb32Gk' title='Video of the infamous Hamilton-Burr duel on youtube.com' target='_blank'>infamous duel</a>, there is <a href='https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241' title='Link to the Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr, [28 June–10 July 1804], by Alexander Hamilton, at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>ample evidence</a> that Hamilton <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel#Hamilton&apos;s_intentions' title='Wikipedia page for the Hamilton-Burr duel, cued to the section on Hamiltons intentions' target='_blank'>intended</a> to throw his shot away.  And if Hamilton actually did <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloping#Notable_uses' title='Wikipedia page for Deloping, cued to the section on Notable_uses, which begins by mentioning the Hamilton-Burr duel' target='_blank'>throw away</a> his shot on that fateful day, then he effectively died for <em>refusing</em> to <q>hate</q> Burr &mdash; someone who fully intended to <em>kill</em> him &mdash; and someone who, sadly, was successful.</p><p>Hate is an emotion, but Hamilton, Jefferson, and Adams were predominantly logical people.  Emotions &mdash; such as those that dominated the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution' title='Wikipedia page for the French Revolution' target='_blank'>French Revolution</a> around this time &mdash; are the driving force behind mobs.</p><p>Although Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson became political rivals, these three were nonetheless strongly united in their contempt for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot' title='Wikipedia page for Riots' target='_blank'>mob violence</a>.  It is actually the <em>lack</em> of hatred and <em>predominance of reason</em> that made the American Revolution much less bloody than the one in France.</p><p>Saying the Founding Fathers <q>hated</q> each other sounds shocking because it's <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=hyperbole' title='Link to the term hyperbole at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>hyperbole</a> &mdash; essentially <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fake+news' title='Link to the term fake news at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>fake news</a> &mdash; at best, a poor choice of words.  If Alexander Hamilton was a more emotional person, and more likely to be a <q>hater,</q> the tendency to be emotional would show up as more Red in his spiritual portrait.</p><hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143034758' title='Link to the biography at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>biography</a> of Alexander Hamilton by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow' title='Wikipedia page for Ron Chernow' target='_blank'>Ron Chernow</a> (2004).  There is also an <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrGi48Kx-As' title='American Experience video about Alexander Hamilton on youtube.com' target='_blank'>American Experience video</a> about Hamilton's life on youtube, but Chernow's book &mdash; which is over 720 pages long &mdash; is far more comprehensive.</p><p>Admirably, Chernow addresses common prejudices readers might bring to his subject by starting his book with this observation:</p><blockquote>For many years after the duel, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and other political enemies had taken full advantage of their eloquence and longevity to spread defamatory anectdotes about Hamilton, who had been condemned to everlasting silence.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From the Prologue to <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130.Alexander_Hamilton' title='Link to the biography of Alexander Hamilton at www.goodreads.com' target='_blank'>Alexander Hamilton</a> by Ron Chernow, 2004 (p. 2).</blockquote><p>Given that <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to the gallery spiritual self-portraits of yours truly on this site'>yours truly</a> is a <q>fairly huge fan</q> of <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site'>Thomas Jefferson</a>, this sentence forced me to acknowledge my preconceptions and approach the biography with a freshly opened mind.  Of course, I remain a fan of Jefferson, but am now a fan of Hamilton as well!</p><p>Because <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp5JCrSXkJY' title='Video of the song For What It&apos;s Worth by Buffalo Springfield on youtube.com' target='_blank'>for what it's worth</a>, I believe that when it comes to our <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/groups/founding-fathers' title='Link to a page about the Founding Fathers at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a>, there <q><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSIajKGHZRk' title='Video of the song Uncle John&apos;s Band by the Grateful Dead on youtube.com' target='_blank'>ain't no time to hate</a>.</q></p>",
