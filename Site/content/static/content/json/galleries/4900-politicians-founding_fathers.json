In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he used logic to write pamphlets explaining his position on controversial issues, such as the assumption of state debts by the federal government for the Revolutionary War.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.

      "story_intro_html": "<p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton' title='Wikipedia page for Alexander Hamilton' target='_blank'>Alexander Hamilton</a> was born on January 11 of either 1755 or 1757, in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlestown,_Nevis' title='Wikipedia page for Charlestown' target='_blank'>Charlestown</a>, the capital of the island of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevis' title='Wikipedia page for the island of Nevis' target='_blank'>Nevis</a> in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Sea' title='Wikipedia page for the Caribbean Sea' target='_blank'>Caribbean Sea</a>.</p><p>Although no one is sure which year he was born, it <em>is</em> certain he was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)' title='Wikipedia page for the term Legitimacy' target='_blank'>illegitimate</a>, the youngest of the seven <q>key</q>&nbsp;<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Founding Fathers of the United States' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a>, and the only one of that group who was born outside of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies' title='Wikipedia page for the Thirteen Colonies' target='_blank'>Thirteen Colonies</a>.</p> <h4>Hamilton, the Decider</h4><p>Because his parents were unmarried, Alexander Hamilton and his brother James were unable to attend school at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England' title='Wikipedia page for the Church of England' target='_blank'>Church of England</a>.  He supplemented the tutoring he received at a private school with reading his family's books.</p><p>Still a teenager, Hamilton came to America in 1772 and, after a year or so, began studying at King's College (now <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_College,_Columbia_University' title='Wikipedia page for Columbia College and Columbia University' target='_blank'>Columbia</a>) in New York City.  He was exposed to and soon joined the patriots' revolutionary cause, and served as one of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%27s_aides-de-camp' title='Wikipedia page for Washingtons aides de camp' target='_blank'>Washington's aides de camp</a> for four years.</p><p>The decisiveness that Alexander Hamilton developed during his youth &mdash; represented by the vast amount of Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; served him well during the war, giving him courage and conviction.  After the war, his strong will and ability to reason led him to pursue a career in law.</p> <h4>The Inevitable Push-back</h4><p>Anyone who has ever been among decisive people, whether it be on a playground or in a board room, can certainly confirm this observation:</p><blockquote>Men often oppose a thing, merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;Alexander Hamilton, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Authorship' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers, cued to the section about their Authorship' target='_blank'>Publius</a> in <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-70' title='Link to Federalist No. 70 at www.congress.gov' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 70</a>, March 18, 1788.</blockquote><p>Even as a young man, Hamilton was rather over-qualified for, or at least a bit bored by, his law career.  He became interested in the politics of the new nation, and his father-in-law <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Schuyler' title='Wikipedia page for Philip Schuyler' target='_blank'>Philip Schuyler</a> chose him to represent New York in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Constitutional Convention' target='_blank'>Constitutional Convention</a> in 1787.</p><p>The push-back Hamilton had been experiencing in the war and his work as a lawyer was soon to get worse, driving him to join <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison' title='Wikipedia page for James Madison' target='_blank'>James Madison</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay' title='Wikipedia page for John Jay' target='_blank'>John Jay</a> in writing the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers' target='_blank'>Federalist Papers</a>.  These publications are sometimes mistakenly thought to be Hamilton's alone, because he initiated and managed the series, and while Madison wrote 29 and Jay penned just 5, the ambitious and decisive Alexander wrote 51 of them.</p> <h4>Hamilton, the Realist</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton's experiences in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War' title='Wikipedia page for the American Revolutionary War' target='_blank'>Revolutionary War</a> were a driving force behind his desire for a strong <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the Federal government of the United States' target='_blank'>Federal Government</a>.  As Washington's aide, he saw first hand how the lack of essential supplies &mdash; food, weapons, uniforms, and even pay for the soldiers &mdash; dangerously hampered the war effort.</p><p>With <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion' title='Wikipedia page for Shays Rebellion' target='_blank'>Shay's Rebellion</a> in 1786 and 1787, America had already experienced a militant uprising that threatened the lives of law-abiding citizens.  However, the country's standing army was miniscule, and with no codified way to repay lingering debt for the recently-won Revolution, Hamilton knew it would be very difficult to find new recruits.</p><p>Alexander Hamilton's prevailing realism &mdash; represented by the Yellow in his spiritual portrait &mdash; represents his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(international_relations)' title='Wikipedia page for realism in foreign affairs' target='_blank'>realism</a>, which contrasts quite strongly with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealism' title='Wikipedia page for Idealism' target='_blank'>idealism</a> of <a href='https://home.monticello.org/' title='Link to the home page at home.monticello.org' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson</a>.  Where Jefferson envisioned a rural, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrarian_society' title='Wikipedia page for agrarian society' target='_blank'>agrarian society</a>, Hamilton foresaw large cities and the variety of commerce necessary to support them.</p><p>Their differing perspectives are especially evident with regards to the idea of a standing army.  While Jefferson thought the United States could remain neutral without a standing military, Hamilton knew this was a complete fantasy:</p><blockquote>Let us recollect that peace or war will not always be left to our option; that however moderate or unambitious we may be, we cannot count upon the moderation, or hope to extinguish the ambition of others.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;Alexander Hamilton, as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers#Authorship' title='Wikipedia page for the Federalist Papers, cued to the section about their Authorship' target='_blank'>Publius</a> in <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-34' title='Link to Federalist No. 34 at ' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 34</a>, January 4, 1788.</blockquote> <p>x</p> <h4>Hamilton, the Meta-President</h4><p>Alexander Hamilton was never president.  This is probably due to a <a href='https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-Alexander-Hamilton-run-for-president' title='Link to a number of reasons why Alexander Hamilton was never president at www.quora.com' target='_blank'>number of reasons</a>, including the illegitimacy and other circumstances of his birth, his young age, and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Reynolds_sex_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Hamilton-Maria Reynolds scandal' target='_blank'>Maria Reynolds scandal</a>.</p><p>He could rightly be called a <q><em>meta-president,</em></q> though.</p><p>As a member of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Constitutional Convention' target='_blank'>Constitutional Convention</a> he had a role in creating and defining the presidency.  And his <a href='https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-70' title='Link to Federalist No. 70 at www.congress.gov' target='_blank'>Federalist No. 70</a>, entitled <q>The Executive Department Further Considered,</q> outlines the specific duties of the president in considerable detail.</p><p>And as someone with a considerable amount of pull with the presidential electors, he could make or break candidates in the first few elections.  Indeed, he was even instrumental in getting the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives' title='Wikipedia page for the US House of Representatives' target='_blank'></a> to award the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1800#House_election_of_1801' title='Wikipedia page for the election of 1800' target='_blank'>election of 1800</a> to Thomas Jefferson instead of Aaron Burr.</p> <p>x</p> <h4>A Complicated Assumption</h4> <p>x</p> <p>Complicated by soldiers selling IOUs to speculators.  Decided to repay at full value (logical/objective).</p> <p>Complicated by different states owing different amounts.  (Look up which ones in Chernow's book.)</p> <p>Dinners in the summer of 1790 led to compromise to move the capitol.</p> <p>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Report_on_the_Public_Credit' title='Wikipedia page for the First Report on the Public Credit' target='_blank'>First Report on the Public Credit</a> led to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790' title='Wikipedia page for the Compromise of 1790' target='_blank'>Compromise of 1790</a>.</p> <p>And that led to the two-party system.</p> <p>x</p> <blockquote>[N]othing could be more ill-judged than that intolerant spirit which has, at all times, characterized political parties.  In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proselyte' title='Wikipedia page for proselyte' target='_blank'>proselytes</a> by fire and sword.
