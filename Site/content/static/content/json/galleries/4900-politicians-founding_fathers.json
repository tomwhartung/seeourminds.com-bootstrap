      "explain_dom": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Alexander Hamilton's dominant personality trait, his rationality.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he used logic to write pamphlets explaining his position on controversial issues, such as the assumption of state debts by the federal government for the Revolutionary War.",
      "explain_aux": "The Yellow in this spiritual portrait represents Alexander Hamilton's auxiliary personality trait, his realistic outlook.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this trait in his ongoing insistence that America needed a strong military to protect its borders and presence on the seas.",
