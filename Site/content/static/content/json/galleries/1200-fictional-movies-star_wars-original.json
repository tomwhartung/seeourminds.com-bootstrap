      "story_intro_html": "<p>When <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker' title='Wookieepedia page for Luke Skywalker ' target='_blank'>Luke Skywalker</a> was a child growing up on the remote planet of <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tatooine/Legends' title='Wookieepedia page for Tatooine' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a>, he didn't realize he had a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa' title='Wookieepedia page for Leia Organa' target='_blank'>twin sister</a> and the potential to become a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi_Knight' title='Wookieepedia page for Jedi Knight' target='_blank'>Jedi Knight</a>.</p><p>All this changes one day when he and his uncle purchase two droids, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/R2-D2' title='Wookieepedia page for R2-D2' target='_blank'>R2-D2</a> and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/C_3PO' title='Wookieepedia page for C-3PO' target='_blank'>C-3PO</a>.  R2-D2 is on a mission to deliver a message to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi/Legends' title='Wookieepedia page for Obi-Wan Kenobi' target='_blank'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, and the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a> is determined to stop the droid.</p> <h4>Had Enough of Tatooine</h4><p>In the Empire's search for R2-D2, they kill Luke's adoptive parents, brutally burning their bodies to a crisp &mdash; probably while they were still alive.  Luke is, however, able to help R2-D2 succeed in delivering the message to Obi-Wan.</p><p>The message is from <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa' title='Wookieepedia page for Princess Leia' target='_blank'>Princess Leia</a>, who is part of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic' title='Wookieepedia page for the Rebel Alliance' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a>.  She is desperate for Obi-Wan's help in the fight for freedom against the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a>.</p><p>Obi-Wan asks Luke if he would be willing to help him help the Princess.  Luke responds that he's had enough of Tatooine:</p><blockquote>I want to come with you to Alderaan.  There's nothing for me here now.  I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Luke in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Luke has obviously felt stifled growing up on such a remote planet, and he was clearly horrified when he saw how the Empire murdered his adoptive parents in cold blood.  When Obi-Wan tells him he'll have to sell his speeder, Luke responds somewhat bitterly, <q>That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.</q></p> <h4>Learning About the Force</h4><p>Luke Skywalker's spiritual portrait, like those of his friend <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a> and his mentor <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a>, contains a lot of Blue.  As with the other Jedi, the Blue represents his strong preference for ideas rather than facts, and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/The_Force' title='Wookieepedia page for the force' target='_blank'>the force</a> is the single most important idea in the life of a <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jedi' title='Wookieepedia page for the Jedi' target='_blank'>Jedi</a>.</p><p>Luke learns a few tidbits about the force from Obi-Wan, but his mentoring about the force doesn't start in earnest until he meets Yoda in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</a>.  After escaping from a monster's lair and struggling in a snowstorm, he has fallen down face-first in the snow.  As he is lying there, the deceased Obi-Wan Kenobi appears to him, as if in a vision.</p><blockquote>Obi-Wan Kenobi: Luke.  Luke!<br />Luke Skywalker: Ben?<br />Obi-Wan: You will go to the Dagobah system.<br />Luke: Dagobah system.<br />Obi-Wan: There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed me.<br />Luke: Ben!  [Obi-Wan's image fades, replaced by the real live Han Solo.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>On Dagobah, Yoda teaches him Jedi ideals and skills.  ______,</p><p>Luke's training is cut a bit short when he senses his new friends, Leia and Han, are in trouble.</p><blockquote>Luke: I saw a city in the clouds.<br />Yoda: Mmm.  Friends you have there.<br />Luke: They were in pain.<br />Yoda: It is the future you see.<br />Luke: The future...  Will they die?<br />Yoda: Difficult to say.  Always in motion is the future.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote><p>______.</p> <h4>Green: Logic</h4> <p>Luke Skywalker has a very weak preference for making logical rather than emotional decisions.  When they first meet, Yoda picks up on Luke's prejudices and teases him a bit:</p> <blockquote>Yoda: Help you I can.  Yes, mmm.<br />Luke: I don't think so.  I'm looking for a great warrior.<br />Yoda: Oh!  Great warrior.  Wars not make one great.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote> <p> </p> <blockquote>Luke: I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'm gonna need it to get out of this slimy mudhole.<br />Yoda: Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote> <p>Later, over dinner, Yoda reveals his identity, and he and Luke build a strong mentoring relationship.</p> <p>Luke lets his emotions &mdash; his love for his friends &mdash; get the better of him when he abandons his Jedi training before it's complete to go and rescue them.</p> <blockquote>Yoda: Only a fully trained Jedi knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor.  If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.<br />Obi-Wan: Patience!<br />Luke: And sacrifice Han and Leia?<br />Yoda: If you honor what they fight for?  Yes!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980.</blockquote> <p>Luke loses his fight with Vader, but fortunately Yoda's prediction does not come true.</p> <h4>Similar to Yoda and Obi-Wan</h4> <p>Maybe something here about ambiversion.  Luke's score is very high, but in The Force Awakens he's turned into a total recluse.  Hmm.  See pp. 148-151 of Star Wars Psychology book.</p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> </p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the Star Wars <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the original trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a>:</p><ul><li>Episode IV: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977</li><li>Episode V: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980</li><li>Episode VI: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983</li></ul><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at ' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
