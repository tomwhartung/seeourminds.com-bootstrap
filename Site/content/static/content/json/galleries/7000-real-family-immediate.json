      "story_html": "<p>Growing up in Richmond, Virginia in the 1960s meant watching assassinations, riots and a war on TV, listening to The Beatles and all the others, and watching too many musicians die of overdoses and the like.  We could drink 3.2 beer on our 18th birthday, whoo-hoo!</p><p>With that youthful feeling of immortality combined with the impending doom of the Cold War hanging over our heads, it was a good time to smoke cigarettes.  In Richmond in those days, they were 25 cents a pack.  Also there were friends, beer and The Grateful Dead, and work and school.</p><p>My Dad offered to help me with school, and I accepted it for the first year or so.  But by then they were divorcing and I decided to pay my own way through it.  My idealism certainly played a factor in this decision.</p><p>My parents' divorce was very acrimonious.  Eventually they cut off all communication with each other, completely and entirely.  The divorce was one thing, but that sort of ongoing hostility really made things quite difficult.</p><p>Of course, I focused on school, work, and having fun with friends.  And as far as <q>making lemonade</q> when given lemons is concerned, it's safe to say that frustration with their <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkAlr90k23Y' title='Video of Teach Your Children on youtube.com' target='_blank'>behavior</a> during this time certainly led to my interest in psychology &mdash; and ultimately to the creation of this site.</p><p>Since getting them to answer the questionnaire, I wonder sometimes whether the divorce may have had something to do with their personality types being so similar?  Certainly there were many factors at work with all this; moreover, it's best to try to just move on.</p><p>So I worked my way through school, sometimes at part-time jobs, and sometimes at full-time jobs.  During this time, I had full-time jobs at <a href='https://www.facebook.com/pages/Overnite-Transportation/163666416984656' title='Facebook page for Overnite Transportation' target='_blank'>Overnite Transportation</a>, <a href='http://www.richmondgov.com/' title='Home page of The City of Richmond VA' target='_blank'>The City of Richmond VA</a>, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Virginia' title='Wikipedia page for The Bank of Virginia' target='_blank'>The Bank of Virginia</a>.</p><p>Working every day, it took awhile, but eventually I earned my B.S. in Math (Computer Science) and a Masters of Interdisciplinary Studies from Virginia Commonwealth University <a href='https://www.vcu.edu/' title='Home page of Virginia Commonwealth University' target='_blank'>(VCU)</a>.</p><p>After getting my B.S. in Math, I had to take <em>a lot</em> of additional courses in Art just to get accepted into the prestigious &mdash; at that time &mdash; Interdisciplinary program.  (VCU no longer offers that degree.)  Fortunately I love learning about Art and especially Art History!</p><p>It wound up taking me seventeen years &mdash; from 1972 through 1989 &mdash; to finish the Masters Degree, but I had quit for four years (so it was really <q>only</q> thirteen years) and changed my major a few times.</p><p>Moreover I did it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyb_alTkMQ' title='Official video of Sid Vicious doing My Way on youtube.com' target='_blank'>My Way,</a> and have no regrets &mdash; except maybe for the stupid tobacco habit.  Although I spent much of the time working, I loved going to school &mdash; and continue to love learning to this day!</p><p>I eventually quit the ciggies in 2002, and only wish I'd quit sooner.  But that story is for another day.</p><p>As the creator of this site, I have a separate gallery that contains multiple self-portraits, along with a story for each one.</p><p>You can see these images and read the stories in the <a href='/gallery/9100-real-self_portraits/' title='Link to gallery of self-portraits on this site'>gallery of self-portraits</a> on this site.</p>",
