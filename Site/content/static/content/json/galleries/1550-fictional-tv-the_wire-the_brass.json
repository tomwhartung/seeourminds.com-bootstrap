These are the images of rational decision-makers who are used to getting their way.</p><p>The image of Cedric's personality shows he has a bit more flexibility than most of the others.   More significant is Howard Colvin's spiritual portrait, which shows how although his personality is also dominated by logic, he is also open to new &mdash; and as viewers learn, even extremely radical &mdash; ideas.</p>",
