      "story_html": "<p>Both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt are ESTJs, but there are some subtle yet important differences in their personalities.</p><h4>TR: More Emotional Than FDR</h4><p>There is more Red in Theodore's spiritual portrait than there is in his <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Spiritual portrait of Franklin Roosevelt on this site' target='_blank'> cousin FDR's image</a>.  This is because TR's personality profile is more decisive and emotional (less <q>Thinking</q>) than his cousin.</p><p>Above all, Theodore admired &mdash; and demonstrated &mdash; courage.<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts. ... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ... who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.</blockquote><p>While campaigning for president in 1912, a man <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do89pViPkvU' title='Video about Theodore being shot on youtube.com' target='_blank'>shot Theodore</a>, but TR carried on and delived the 90-minute speech he had planned nonetheless.  Doctors later learned what TR already knew &mdash; that there was no damage to his lung &mdash; and decided it would be preferable to leave the bullet inside his chest.</p><p>Like <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5006/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Andrew Jackson on this site'>Andrew Jackson</a>, Theodore Roosevelt carried a bullet inside his body for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt#Assassination_attempt' title='Wikipedia page for TR, cued to section about this assassination attept' target='_blank'>rest of his life</a>.</p><h4>Plenty of Similarities</h4><p>Although they belonged to different political parties &mdash; TR was a Republican and FDR a Democrat &mdash; both were concerned that the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few could lead to the exploitation of average citizens:</p><blockquote>Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on the contrary, these big aggregations are an inevitable development of modern industrialism. ... We are not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall be so handled as to subserve the public good. We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth.</blockquote> <p>And both Presidents Roosevelt experienced a great deal of physical pain their final years, dying while still fairly young, in their early 60s.  Quoting from his autobiography, published in 1913, it is plain he had no regrets:</p><blockquote>It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks, and the greatest of all prizes are those connected with the home. No father and mother can hope to escape sorrow and anxiety, and there are dreadful moments when death comes very near those we love, even if for the time being it passes by. But life is a great adventure, and the worst of all fears is the fear of living.</blockquote><p>For more TR quotes, see his <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt' title='Wikiquote page for Theodore Roosevelt' target='_blank'>page at wikiquote.org</a>.</p><hr /><p>It was easy creating Theodore Roosevelt's personality profile.

The horror of it made an impression that would affect him for the rest of his life.</p><h4>Decisive Debater</h4><p>As a student at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College' title='Wikipedia page for Davidson College' target='_blank'>Davidson College</a> in North Carolina, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University' title='Wikipedia page for Princeton University' target='_blank'>Princeton University</a> in New Jersey, and at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia_School_of_Law' title='Wikipedia page for The University of Virginia School of Law' target='_blank'>University of Virginia School of Law</a>, Woodrow studied history, philosophy and law, and enjoyed debating.</p><p>Woodrow's decisiveness, and his ability to reason clearly and debate passionately, is evident in the ample amount of Green and the substantial amount of Red in his spiritual portrait.  It's obvious he would have made a formidable debater.</p><h4>American Idealist</h4><p>Wilson also considered himself to be an idealist, and considered idealism to be an essential part of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the United States of America' target='_blank'>America</a> and being an American.  This idealism is evident in the Blue in his spiritual portrait.</p><blockquote>Sometimes people call me an idealist. Well, that is the way I know I am an American. America, my fellow citizens - I do not say it in disparagement of any other great people - America is the only idealistic Nation in the world.</blockquote><p>Woodrow's idealism and his first-hand experience with war as a child caused him to be reluctant to allow the US to enter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I' title='Wikipedia page for World War I' target='_blank'>World War I</a> and look for a peaceful solution instead.  This stance helped him <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1916' title='Wikipedia page for the United States presidential election in 1916' target='_blank'>win re-election in 1916</a>.</p><h4>World War I and WW's Fourteen Points</h4><p>After Germany sank several American merchant ships, and then England intercepted the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram' title='Wikipedia page for Zimmermann Telegram' target='_blank'>Zimmermann Telegram</a>, sent by Germany to Mexico, Woodrow abandoned his anti-war stance, and appealed to Congress to declare war.  Congress did so on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1917)' title='Wikipedia page for the United States declaration of war on Germany' target='_blank'>April 2, 1917</a>.</p><p>Woodrow Wilson's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsonianism' title='Wikipedia page for Wilsonianism' target='_blank'>idealism</a> persisted, however, and when America entered the war he gave a speech to Congress known as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points' title='Wikipedia page for the Fourteen Points' target='_blank'>Fourteen Points</a>.  This speech outlines the way to a lasting peace, and the last of the Fourteen Points calls for the creation of an association of nations.</p><h4>Attempts to Prevent World War II</h4><p>He then sought to implement the last of these Fourteen Points and prevent future wars by working to create the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations' title='Wikipedia page for the League of Nations' target='_blank'>League of Nations</a>.  He was convinced that this organization was the key to preventing another war that would be even worse the World War I.</p><blockquote>I can predict with absolute certainty that within another generation there will be another world war if the nations of the world do not concert the method by which to prevent it.</blockquote><p>Ultimately Congress refused to consent to America joining the League, claiming the United States needed to maintain its independence from external influences.  Although he was very disappointed in this, Woodrow won the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize' title='Wikipedia page for the Nobel Peace Prize' target='_blank'>Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1919 for his efforts.</p><h4>WW Versus TR</h4><p>It is interesting to compare Woodrow's spiritual portrait with that of <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5040/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Theodore Roosevelt on this site'>Theodore Roosevelt</a>.  Both were very decisive, but TR frequently criticized Woodrow for opposing Ameria's entry into World War I.</p><p>Their decisiveness is evident in the large amounts of Green and Red in both portraits.  The difference between them is also evident, the Yellow in TR's image showing his obvious desire for immediate action, ane the Blue in WW's image showing his underlying idealism.</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the <a href='http://www.pbs.org/show/american-experience/' title='Link to the American Experience page at pbs.org' target='_blank'>American Experience</a> documentary, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307674/' title='Page for Woodrow Wilson and the Birth of the American Century on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Woodrow Wilson and the Birth of the American Century</a>.</p>",

This idealism is exemplified in what may well be his most famous quote, from his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy' title='Wikipedia page for the inauguration address delivered by JFK' target='_blank'>inauguration address</a>:</p><blockquote>Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.</blockquote><p>After the last two democratic presidents, <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of FDR on this site'>FDR</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman' title='Wikipedia page for Harry S.

He chose to make it obvious right from the start that he knew there was no way he could take on the challenges he faced and do the job felt needed doing all by himself.</p><h4>Keeping a Cool Head</h4><p>Kennedy's challenges started early in his administration.  The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion' title='Wikipedia page for the Bay of Pigs Invasion' target='_blank'>Bay of Pigs Invasion</a> in April of 1961 taught him that rushing into action &mdash; even with the approval of experienced and trusted advisors &mdash; could have disasterous consequences.</p><p>Although plans for the invation were initiated by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower' title='Wikipedia page for Dwight D. Eisenhower' target='_blank'>Eisenhower</a> administration, and the operation was overseen and run by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency' title='Wikipedia page for the Central Intelligence Agency' target='_blank'>Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA), Kennedy took full responsibility for its failure.  This is remarkable when compared to some politicians in today's political climate.</p><p>The Bay of Pigs fiasco turned out to be only the first of many challenges he had to face.  With his fairly strong preference for being rational, was able to keep his cool through the worst of them &mdash; at least in public, if not always in private.</p><h4>Balancing Perception and Decisiveness</h4><p>JFK's personality profile shows his preference for perceiving over judging is very slight.  As the following quote demonstrates, he realized it is important to find the correct balance between acting too soon and not acting at all.</p><blockquote>There are risks and costs to action.

His pragmatism in helping to cover up the criminal acts may have caused his downfall, but he did his best to maintain some sense of personal honor.</p><h4>Ending the War in Vietnam</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Doctrine' title='Wikipedia page for the Nixon Doctrine' target='_blank'>Nixon Doctrine</a> the President set forth in 1969, he called for <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamization' title='Wikipedia page for Vietnamization' target='_blank'>Vietnamization</a></q> of the region.  Nixon hoped that by using troops from the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Republic_of_Vietnam' title='Wikipedia page for Army of the Republic of Vietnam' target='_blank'>South Vietnamese Army</a> (ARVN) he could end <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_the_United_States_in_the_Vietnam_War' title='Wikipedia page for Americas involvement in the war in Vietnam' target='_blank'>America's involvement</a> in the region.</p><p>In both of his terms as president, Richard Nixon worked with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Kissinger' title='Wikipedia page for Henry Kissinger' target='_blank'>Henry Kissinger</a>, his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for National Security Advisor' target='_blank'>National Security Advisor</a>, on a number of fronts to end America's involvement in the Vietnam War.

Determined to be a peacemaker, the tenacious, decisive Nixon refused to give up.</p><p>In a speech Nixon gave upon being reelected in 1972, he uses the word <q>peace</q> six times in a single sentence:</p><blockquote>We are united Americans &mdash; North, East, West, and South, both parties &mdash; in our desire for peace, <b>peace with honor</b>, the kind of a peace that will last, and we are moving swiftly toward that great goal, not just in Vietnam, but a new era of peace in which the old relationships between the two super powers, the Soviet Union and the United States, and between the world's most populous nation, the People's Republic of China, and the United States, are changed so that we are on the eve of what could be the greatest generation of peace, true peace for the whole world, that man has ever known.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Richard Nixon's <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3702' title='Link to the full text of Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>Remarks on Being Reelected to the Presidency</a>, November 7, 1972.

In calling for <q>peace with honor,</q> Richard Nixon makes it obvious he disagreed with <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-franklin-9301234' title='Link to Benjamin Franklin at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Benjamin Franklin</a>'s sentiment, expressed in a letter to his friend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Quincy_I' title='Wikipedia page for Josiah Quincy I' target='_blank'>Josiah Quincy</a> in 1783, that <q><a href='https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-40-02-0385' title='Link to the entire letter at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>there never was a good war, or a bad peace</a>.</q></p><p>Richard Nixon's preference for logic &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; along with his fervent anti-communism, would not let him agree to peace at any cost, despite the ongoing and intensifying emotional anti-war protests.  Doing so would be considered weakness and imply a willingness to allow South Vietnam to submit to North Vietnamese aggression.</p><p>And Nixon's preference for pragmatism &mdash; represented by the Yellow in his portrait &mdash; caused him to order increases in the bombings when attempts to help the opposing sides reach agreement stalled.  Bombs are facts that are impossible to ignore.</p><p>In one example of these pragmatic, destructive tactics, Nixon and Kissinger started seeing some <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords#Breakthrough_and_agreement' title='Wikipedia page for the Paris Peace Accords, cued to the section on Breakthrough and agreement' target='_blank'>breakthroughs</a> in the peace process in 1972, yet encountered resistance from the President of the South Vietnamese, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguy%E1%BB%85n_V%C4%83n_Thi%E1%BB%87u' title='Wikipedia page for Nguyễn Văn Thiệu' target='_blank'>Nguyễn Văn Thiệu</a>.

Richard Nixon was only human, and sadly, his efforts failed in the long run.</p><p>But it's important to realize that when it came to bringing peace to Vietnam, he did his best.  And despite his foibles, Nixon certainly managed to save countless lives in his tireless pursuit of <q>peace with honor</q> and his successful negotiation of the withdrawl of America troops from Southeast Asia &mdash; something his predecessors failed to do.</p><h4>Richard Milhous Nixon and Ronald Wilson Reagan</h4><p>Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan shared many similarities: they were both born in the early 1910s, their names have the same number of syllables, and as adults they chose to be Republicans and call California their home.</p><p>Even more significantly, the large amounts of Green in their spiritual portraits show a preference for making rational decisions &mdash; a trait they share with many leaders.  As anti-communist would-be peacemakers, they were willing to <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=parley' title='Page for the term parley at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>parley</a>, but had no intention of making any concession they thought might compromise the freedoms of their fellow Americans.</p><p>As presidents, when people in their administrations broke the law, they reacted differently &mdash; and ultimately paid different prices for their actions.  Where Reagan took appropriate action and put an abrupt end to the malfeasance, Nixon persisted in trying to cover things up.</p><p>This is not to imply that pragmatic people are less moral than idealistic people, only that their perceptions and ultimately their motivations are different.</p><p>Spiritual portraits provide a unique view into why people act the way they do, allowing us to learn from others' mistakes &mdash; and emulate those who do the right thing.</p><h4>&ndash;&nbsp;&ndash;</h4><p>Richard Nixon died at the age of 81 on April 22, 1994.

As his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Richard Nixon did when running for President in 1968, Reagan leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate in his campaign for re-election in 1970.</p><h4>Peacemaker</h4><p>Ronald Reagan's anti-communist, law-and-order stance does not imply he was an enemy of peace.</p><p>As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, Ronald Reagan preferred logic to emotion.  So although both he and the protesters wanted peace, he differed from them in that he was not inclined to get all emotional about it.</p><blockquote>I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan, in his <a href='http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-28-1980-debate-transcript' title='Link to the presidential debate between Reagan and Carter at www.debates.org' target='_blank'>presidential debate</a> with Jimmy Carter, October 28, 1980.</blockquote><p>In the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY' title='Video of A Time for Choosing on youtube.com' target='_blank'><em>A Time for Choosing</em></a> speech Reagan gave supporting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater' title='Wikipedia page for Barry Goldwater' target='_blank'>Barry Goldwater</a> in 1964, he quotes <a href='/image/4900-politicians-founding_fathers/4900/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'>Alexander Hamilton</a>, Patrick Henry, and Winston Churchill in explaining that Goldwater desired not just peace, but <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/04/text-of-goldwaters-speech-formally-opening-presidential-campaign.html' title='Link to the text of Goldwaters speech formally opening his presidential campaign at www.nytimes.com' target='_blank'>peace through strength</a>.</p><h4>Crisis: Iran-Contra</h4><p>When Ronald Reagan ran for re-election in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1984' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election of 1984' target='_blank'>presidential election of 1984</a>, he won by a landslide.  Garnering almost 59% of the popular vote, he carried all but one state.</p><p>Like many other two-term presidents, he fell prey to the <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-term_curse' title='Wikipedia page for the alleged curse on the second term of presidents' target='_blank'>second-term curse</a>,</q> a superstition that may betray the all-too-human tendency towards <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias' title='Wikipedia page for confirmation bias' target='_blank'>confirmation bias</a>.  In Reagan's case, the curse did indeed <q>come true,</q> at least to a certain extent.</p><p>Ronald Reagan believed the forces behind democracy and freedom were stronger than those behind communism and tyranny.  In a <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=38274' title='Link to a copy of the speech at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>speech</a> given at the Annual Dinner of the <a href='http://cpac.conservative.org/' title='Link to the Conservative Political Action Conference home page at cpac.conservative.org' target='_blank'>Conservative Political Action Conference</a> (CPAC) on March 1, 1985 he declared that the freedom fighters in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua' title='Wikipedia page for Nicaragua' target='_blank'>Nicaragua</a> &mdash; known as the <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras' title='Wikipedia page for the contras' target='_blank'>contras</a></q> &mdash; were <q>the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance.</q></p><p>Reagan wanted to support the Nicaraguan rebels, but <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Congress' target='_blank'>Congress</a> had passed the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boland_Amendment' title='Wikipedia page for the Boland Amendment' target='_blank'>Boland Amendment</a> forbidding it.  Unbeknownst to Reagan, people in his administration had started diverting funds from arms sales to Iran to the contras in Nicaragua.</p><h4>Reagan's Idealism Backfires</h4><p>As the Blue in his spiritual portrait shows, Reagan embraced ideals &mdash; specifically, religious and patriotic ideals.  As a result, he was an optimist, and it was difficult for him to believe that people in his administration had been breaking the law by diverting funds to the contras.</p><p>In 1986 reports of arms for hostages deals started to appear in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash-Shiraa' title='Wikipedia page for the Ash-Shiraa magazine' target='_blank'>Arab newspapers</a>, reporters in America began pressuring Reagan for answers.  Reagan responded by appearing on national television and addressing the issue in what he &mdash; at that time &mdash; thought was a direct way:</p><blockquote>The charge has been made that the United States has shipped weapons to Iran as ransom payment for the release of American hostages in Lebanon, that the United States undercut its allies and secretly violated American policy against trafficking with terrorists.  Those charges are utterly false.... We did not &mdash; repeat &mdash; did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan in an <a href='https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1986/111386c.htm' title='Link to the Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy at www.reaganlibrary.gov' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy</a>, November 13, 1986.</blockquote><p>Over the next few weeks, the people responsible for the clandestine deals were identified.  By the end of November, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter' title='Wikipedia page for John Poindexter' target='_blank'>John Poindexter</a>, Reagan's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for National Security Advisor' target='_blank'>National Security Advisor</a>, had resigned, and Reagan had fired <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North' title='Wikipedia page for Oliver North' target='_blank'>Oliver North</a>, who was one of the main people behind the malfeasance.</p><h4><q>Lax Managerial Style</q></h4><p>As time went on and more information surfaced, Ronald Reagan's popularity dropped precipitously, and he began to see past his idealism.  Eventually he realized the truth lingering on the other side of his <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rose%20colored%20glasses' title='Page for the term rose-colored glasses at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>rose-colored glasses</a>.</p><p>Amid references to parallels with Richard Nixon's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Watergate scandal' target='_blank'>Watergate scandal</a>, on December 1, 1986 Ronald Reagan created the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission' title='Wikipedia page for the Tower Commission' target='_blank'>Tower Commission</a> to investigate the matter.</p><blockquote>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.  As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages.  This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.  There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.  It was a mistake.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan in an <a href='https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1987/030487h.htm' title='Link to the text of the Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy at www.reaganlibrary.gov' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy</a>, March 4, 1987.</blockquote><p>The commission's report cleared Reagan of wrong-doing, but chastised him for not being fully aware of what people working for him were actually doing.  If he was guilty of anything, it was of having a <q><a href='https://www.salon.com/2011/02/04/busby_iran_contra/' title='Link to an article about the Iran-contra scandal at www.salon.com' target='_blank'>lax managerial style</a>.</q></p><h4>Ending the Cold War</h4><p>While this was going on, Ronald Reagan was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Soviet_Union%E2%80%93United_States_summits#Cold_War_(1985%E2%80%931991)' title='Wikipedia page for the list of summit meetings between the US and the Soviets, cued to the section about the Cold War' target='_blank'>meeting</a> with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev' title='Wikipedia page for Mickhail Gorbachev' target='_blank'>Mickhail Gorbachev</a>, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union' title='Wikipedia page for General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union' target='_blank'>General Secretary</a> of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union' title='Wikipedia page for the Soviet Union' target='_blank'>Soviet Union</a>.  Of particular concern were:</p><ul><li>The possibility of <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N8OWQ06/' title='Link to buy On the Beach at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Nuclear War</a>, which posed a very real threat to all human life on the planet, and</li><li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall' title='Wikipedia page for the Berlin Wall' target='_blank'>Berlin Wall</a>, both an imposing physical barrier and an icon of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War' title='Wikipedia page for the Cold War' target='_blank'>Cold War</a>.</li></ul><p>Regarding nuclear weapons, Ronald Reagan considered them to be <q><a href='http://www.thereaganvision.org/important-letters-papers/' title='Link to part of a letter quoting Nancy Reagan as saying this about Ronnie at www.thereaganvision.org' target='_blank'>totally irrational</a>.</q>  And with regards to the Berlin Wall, in a famous speech he publicly implored the Soviet leader to <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_down_this_wall!' title='Wikipedia page for the phrase Tear down this wall' target='_blank'>tear</a></q> it down:</p><blockquote>General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!

But it serves as an excellent focal point for people seeking to understand the prevailing sentiment about nukes and the wall at that time.</p><h4>Reagan's Logic and Idealism</h4><p>Although he was certainly a fan of the <a href='https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers' title='Link to a page about the Founding Fathers at www.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a>, Ronald Reagan obviously disagreed with <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-franklin-9301234' title='Link to Benjamin Franklin at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Benjamin Franklin</a>'s sentiment, expressed in a letter to his friend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Quincy_I' title='Wikipedia page for Josiah Quincy I' target='_blank'>Josiah Quincy</a> in 1783, that <q><a href='https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-40-02-0385' title='Link to the entire letter at founders.archives.gov' target='_blank'>there never was a good war, or a bad peace</a>.</q></p><p>In this day and age, Franklin's anti-war sentiment is obviously a relic of a time long before the possibility of <a href='http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm' title='Link to a page about mutually assured destruction at www.nuclearfiles.org' target='_blank'>mutually assured destruction</a> (MAD).  Adopting a similar attitude during the Cold War might imply a willingness to submit to the Soviet Empire's aggression, which was clearly unacceptable.</p><p>Ronald Reagan's preference for logic &mdash; represented by the Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; and his fervent anti-communism, would not let him agree to peace at any cost.  If Reagan was going to call for peace, it would be a peace on his terms &mdash; terms that would not compromise his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_patriotism' title='Wikipedia page for American patriotic ideals' target='_blank'>patriotic ideals</a> or any of the freedoms Americans had grown accustomed to over the nation's past 200+ years.</p><p>Equally important, Reagan's preference for idealism &mdash; represented by the Blue in his portrait &mdash; enabled him to <q>think outside the box.</q> Realizing America <q><a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan#Address_on_the_Strategic_Defense_Initiative_(1983)' title='Link to his Address on the Strategic Defense Initiative (1983) at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>will never be an aggressor</a>,</q> he visualized a space-based defensive system.</p><blockquote>What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?

It called for a long-range plan to base defensive weapons in space, and Reagan would spare no expense.</p><p>Soon after this, when <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev' title='Wikipedia page for Mikhail Gorbachev' target='_blank'>Mikhail Gorbachev</a> became <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union' title='Wikipedia page for the General Secretary of the CPSU' target='_blank'>General Secretary</a> of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, he introduced two important reforms: glasnost and perestroika.  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost' title='Wikipedia page for glasnost' target='_blank'>Glasnost</a> called for more openness and transparency in Soviet society, and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika' title='Wikipedia page for perestroika' target='_blank'>perestroika</a> called for more freedom in the economy.</p><p>When Ronald Reagan <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk_Summit' title='Wikipedia page for the summit in Reykjavik' target='_blank'>met with Gorbachev</a>, in October of 1986 in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk' title='Wikipedia page for Reykjavik, Iceland' target='_blank'>Reykjavik</a>, Iceland to discuss nuclear weapons, he quickly saw he was dealing with a new type of Soviet leader, one who was very different from the hard-liners of the past.

Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and closed societies &mdash; West Germany and East Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam &mdash; it is the democratic countries what are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.

As anti-communist would-be peacemakers, they were willing to <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=parley' title='Page for the term parley at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>parley</a>, but had no intention of making any concession they thought might compromise the freedoms of their fellow Americans.</p><p>As presidents, when people in their administrations broke the law, they reacted differently &mdash; and ultimately paid different prices for their actions.  Where Nixon persisted in trying to cover things up, Reagan took appropriate action and put an abrupt end to the malfeasance.</p><p>This is not to imply that idealistic people are more moral than pragmatic people, only that their perceptions and ultimately their motivations are different.</p><p>Spiritual portraits provide a unique view into why people act the way they do, allowing us to learn from others' mistakes &mdash; and emulate those who do the right thing.</p><h4>&ndash;&nbsp;&ndash;</h4><p>Ronald Reagan died at the age of 93 on June 5, 2004.

After a successful career in business, his father was elected to the Senate in 1952, and served as George's role model when he followed in his father's footsteps and entered public life in 1964.</p><h4>An Establishment Republican</h4><p>After serving as a Naval aviator in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a> and attending <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University' title='Wikipedia page for Yale University' target='_blank'>Yale University</a>, Bush moved to Texas and became wealthy working the oil industry.  Feeling a sense of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige' title='Wikipedia page for noblesse oblige' target='_blank'>noblesse oblige</a> &mdash; French for <q>nobility obligates</q> &mdash; he entered politics, as his father had done for much the same reason.</p><p>In the early 1960s, the Republican party was virtually non-existent in Texas.

Bush became Chairman of the nascent Republican Party in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas' title='Wikipedia page for Harris County' target='_blank'>Harris County</a> &mdash; which includes the metropolitan area surrounding <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston' title='Wikipedia page for the city of Houston, Texas' target='_blank'>Houston</a>, Texas.</p><p>Bush initially welcomed the dangerously radical members of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society' title='Wikipedia page for the John Birch Society' target='_blank'>John Birch Society</a>.

These extremists were growing increasingly disaffected with the Democratic party because of Kennedy's and Johnson's position on Civil Rights.</p><p>In 1966 Bush was elected Republican to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives' title='Wikipedia page for the House of Representatives' target='_blank'>House of Representatives</a>.  After voting in favor of Lyndon Johnson's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Housing_Act' title='Wikipedia page for the Fair Housing Act' target='_blank'>Fair Housing Act</a>, he faced backlash from the ex-Democrats who had switched to the Republican Party.</p><h4>Civil Rights: The Backlash</h4><p>Like his fellow Texan Lyndon Johnson, after considerable introspection and contemplation, Bush reconsidered his stance on the issue:</p><blockquote>You got to wrestle with your conscience.  You got to listen to people.  It doesn't come so easy to me that this is right and that's wrong.  It's never that simple.  The tough votes are the ones you agonize over and then you do what you think is right.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/bush/#transcript' title='Link to the transcript of the American Experience video of George H.

Somehow it seems fundamental that a man should not have a door slammed in his face because he is a Negro or speaks with a Latin American accent.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/bush/#transcript' title='Link to the transcript of the American Experience video of George H.

W. Bush on this site'>George H. W. Bush</a> and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5060/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Lyndon B. Johnson on this site'>Lyndon B. Johnson</a> contain more Green &mdash; which represents their objectivity, and Yellow &mdash; which represents their pragmatism.  These similarities in their temperaments help explain how &mdash; despite the differences in their respective political parties &mdash; their experiences with respect to the Civil Rights issue followed similar courses.</p><p>Both were pragmatic enough to realize that being in favor of extending Civil Rights to African Americans in a Texas that was staunchly opposed to these rights would be politically disasterous.  So during their campaigns they felt the purely political need to oppose this sort of legislation.</p><p>Once they won their elections, as civil rights activists like <a href='http://www.thekingcenter.org/about-dr-king' title='Link to an article about Martin Luther King at www.thekingcenter.org' target='_blank'>Martin Luther King</a> brought more attention to the issue, both Bush and Johnson realized that changing their stance on the issue was the right thing to do.</p><h4>Road to the White House</h4><p>In the 1970s, George H. W. Bush's career took him from Congress through stints at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations' title='Wikipedia page for the United Nations' target='_blank'>United Nations</a>, as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_embassy#China_and_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the de facto embassy in China' target='_blank'>Envoy to China</a>, and as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Central_Intelligence' title='Wikipedia page for the position of Director of the Central Intelligence Agency' target='_blank'>Director of the Central Intelligence Agency</a>.</p><p>During the Presidential campaign in 1980, Bush initially ran against <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Ronald Reagan' target='_blank'>Ronald Reagan</a>.  However, after falling behind Reagan in the Republican primary elections, Bush accepted his offer to run as his Vice President.</p><p>Interestingly, it was not a Democrat but actually Bush who coined the term <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics' title='Wikipedia page for Reaganomics, aka. voodoo economics' target='_blank'>voodoo economics</a></q> in reference to Reagan's economic ideas during this campaign.  As a result, even though they shared the ticket, the two of them were not exactly <q> <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080202/' title='Page for the tv show bosom buddies on imdb.com' target='_blank'>bosom buddies</a>.</q></p> <p>After Ronald Reagan served his two terms with George H. W. Bush as his Vice President, Bush ran for president in 1988.  It was during the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Republican_National_Convention' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican Convention in 1988' target='_blank'>Republican Convention</a> that Bush announced his infamous pledge of <q>No new taxes.</q></p><h4>President George Herbert Walker Bush</h4><p>At the urging of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater#1988_election' title='Wikipedia page for ' target='_blank'>Lee Atwater</a>, his campaign manager, Bush reluctantly resorted to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_campaigning' title='Wikipedia page for negative campaigning, aka. mudslinging ' target='_blank'>mudslinging </a> &mdash; specifically by running the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_Door_(advertisement)' title='Wikipedia page for the revolving door ads' target='_blank'>revolving door ads</a> about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton' title='Wikipedia page for Willie Horton' target='_blank'>Willie Horton</a>.  The aggressive tactics worked, and Bush <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1988' title='Wikipedia page for the United States presidential election in 1988' target='_blank'>soundly defeated</a> his opponent <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis' title='Wikipedia page for Michael Dukakis' target='_blank'>Michael Dukakis</a>, carrying 40 of the 50 states and winning 53.4% of the popular vote.</p><p>Certainly one the most significant events occuring during his presidency is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall' title='Wikipedia page for the Berlin_Wall, cued to the part of the page about its fall' target='_blank'>fall of the Berlin Wall</a>.  True to his very cool, objective temperament, Bush's response was understated and unemotional:</p><blockquote> George H.W. Bush: Well, I don't think any single event is the end of what you might call the Iron Curtain, but clearly this is a long way from the harsh days of the harshest Iron Curtain days.  A long way from that.<br />Reporter: You know, in what you just said, that this is a sort of great victory, but you don't seem elated, and I'm wondering if you're thinking.<br />George H.W. Bush: I am elated.  I'm just not an emotional kind of guy.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;George H. W. Bush, <a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/bush/#part01' title='Link to the American Experience video about George H. W. Bush at pbs.org' target='_blank'>American Experience video</a>.</blockquote><p>Bush actually faced criticism for his reaction.  Compared to the powerful statements of previous presidents &mdash; specifically John F. Kennedy's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner' title='Wikipedia page for the Ich bin ein Berliner speech' target='_blank'>Ich bin ein Berliner speech</a> in 1963 and Ronald Reagan's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_down_this_wall!' title='Wikipedia page for the Tear Down This Wall speech' target='_blank'><q>Tear Down This Wall!</q> speech</a> in 1987, Bush felt any sort of self-aggrandizing would be inappropriate, and ultimately everything he said fell flat.</p><p>Of course, it is Bush's character and temperament that sets him apart from his predecessors:</p><blockquote>I am not one who flamboyantly believes in throwing a lot of words around.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From the <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=sELVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage' title='Link to the Public Papers of George Bush at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Public Papers of George Bush</a>, August 11, 1990.</blockquote><p>George Bush's extremely high preference for objectivity &mdash; represented by the large amount of Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; shows he is less comfortable than most when it comes to displaying emotion.  And ultimately his pragmatism &mdash; represented by the Yellow &mdash; made it impossible for him to keep his campaign promise of <q>No new taxes.</q></p><p>Undoubtedly this pragmatism and lack of emotion contributed to his defeat by <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5078/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Bill Clinton on this site'>Bill Clinton</a> in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election of 1992' target='_blank'>presidential election of 1992</a>.</p><h4>Looking Back</h4><p>The 1980s saw the rise of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_in_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for cable television in the United States' target='_blank'>cable television</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_news_cycle' title='Wikipedia page for the 24-hour news cycle' target='_blank'>24-hour news cycle</a>.  Many people believe this trend &mdash; subsequently exacerbated by the free-for-all of the internet &mdash; has led to a decline in journalistic standards and the extreme opinions found in today's political environment.</p><p>In an interview granted to Michael Duffy in 2011, George H. W. Bush puts this trend in an historical perspective:</p><blockquote>Michael Duffy: You used to say, <q>The American people didn't send us here to bicker.</q>  Why can't the two parties compromise anymore?<br />George H. W. Bush: Everybody does seem a little more entrenched these days. But if you read David McCullough's great biographies of Washington or Adams, you find out they were pretty entrenched then too. People forget that Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr had a shoot-out over policy differences. I think the 24-hour news cycle has helped exaggerate the differences between the parties. You can always find someone on TV somewhere carping about something. That didn't happen 20 years ago.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2068093,00.html' title='Link to an article entitled 10 Questions for George H.W.

I used the results of one of these exercises to create this portrait of George H. W. Bush.</p><p>It's interesting that this profile shows Bush's <q>T</q>hinking score to be 100% &mdash; implying he has no <q>F</q>eeling.

The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/us/1992-campaign-reporter-s-notebook-clinton-enjoying-mystery-over-choice-for.html' title='Link to an article about Bill Clinton at www.nytimes.com' target='_blank'>Bill Clinton</a> in a Speech given in 1992.</blockquote><p>While most everyone is capable of realizing they can make mistakes, not everyone is sufficiently humble to acknowledge and learn from them, and fewer still have the capacity to actually change.</p><h4>The Return of Ex-Governor Clinton</h4><p>After Clinton's first term of Governor of Arkansas, he lost his bid for re-election in 1980.  True to his character, he examined what he did wrong &mdash; <q>precinct by precinct</q> &mdash; and won his bid for re-election in 1982.</p><p>One result of Clinton's analysis of what went wrong was he realized he had tried to do too much.  So during his later terms he worked to focus on key issues, such as education.</p><p>As a result, he was re-elected a total of three times and served for another ten years.<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[1]</sup></a>  Taking pride in his ability to learn, grow, and recover from setbacks, Clinton gave himself the nickname <q><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comeback_kid' title='Link to definition of comeback kid at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'>the comeback kid</a>.</q></p><h4>A Preference for Idealism</h4><p>Bill Clinton's preferences may be slight, but they are demonstrable.</p><p>For one thing, Bill's profile reflects a slight preference for idealism over pragmatism, and his spiritual portrait portrays this preference by containing a bit more Blue than Yellow.</p><p>As a teenager, Clinton happily seized on the opportunity to meet <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5058' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John F. Kennedy on this site'>John F. Kennedy</a> in 1963.  The young, idealistic President appealed to young Bill's nascent idealism and helped solidify his growing desire to run for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration' title='Wikipedia page for public administration' target='_blank'>public office</a> when he got older.</p><p>The following quote demonstrates how Clinton had hopes and dreams for a better future &mdash; not just for the short term but for long after his term has ended:</p><blockquote>A hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in this place and report on the State of the Union. He &mdash; or she &mdash; he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Clinton's <a href='https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/New/html/19990119-2656.html' title='Link to the State of the Union Address given by Bill Clinton at clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov' target='_blank'>State of the Union Address</a> January 19, 1999.</blockquote><p>In 1999, someone looking forward just one year, to 2000, could be considered visionary.  The fact that Bill Clinton is looking 100 years into the future, to 2099 &mdash; and anticipating a woman president as a casual aside while he's at it &mdash; is quite remarkable.</p><h4>Ideals Require Action</h4><p>Good, old, down-to-earth pragmatism is quite <q>normal</q> and to be expected in leaders in general &mdash; and Presidents in particular.  In fact, pragmatic Presidents are so common that, in his book <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/presidents.aspx' title='Link to the introduction to the book Presidential Temperament at www.keirsey.com' target='_blank'>Presidential Temperament</a>, David Keirsey claims there have been <a href='https://www.keirsey.com/idealist_presidents.aspx' title='Link to the empty page for Idealist Presidents at keirsey.com' target='_blank'>no Idealist Presidents</a>!<a href='#footnotes' title='Link to the footnotes at the bottom of this page'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p><p>The following quote demonstrates Bill Clinton understands idealism must be more than just words.  For the ideals to be realized, there must also be action:</p><blockquote>Secretary-General Annan spoke for all of us ... when he said that ethnic cleansers and mass murderers can find no refuge in the United Nations, no source of comfort or justification in its charter. We must do more to make these words real. Of course, we must approach this challenge with some considerable degree of humility. It is easy to say, <q>Never again,</q> but much harder to make it so.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Clinton's remarks to the <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton' title='Link to Bill Clinton quotes at en.wikiquote.org' target='_blank'>54th Session of the United Nations General Assembly</a>, September 21, 1999.</blockquote><p>As shown by this quote &mdash; and reflected in his spiritual portrait &mdash; Clinton knows that to be successful, it is necessary to balance pragmatism with idealism.</p><h4>A Preference for Passion</h4><p>Bill Clinton's profile also reflects a slight preference for passion over objectivity, and his spiritual portrait portrays this by containing a bit more Red than Green.</p><p>Clinton's ability to connect emotionally with voters &mdash; for example, as he did in the <a href='https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/bill-clinton-debate_n_1971685.html' title='Link to an article about how Bill Clinton Won 1992 Town Hall Debate By Engaging With One Voter at www.huffingtonpost.com' target='_blank'>1992 presidential debate</a> &mdash; demonstrates his tendency to be more emotional than logical.  This tendency is also evident in his marital indiscretions, which ultimately led to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton' title='Wikipedia page for the Impeachment of Bill Clinton' target='_blank'>the impeachment hearings</a> in his second term.</p><p>Bill Clinton may be a <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democrats' title='Wikipedia page for New Democrats' target='_blank'>New Democrat</a>,</q> but he does not hesitate to differentiate himself from elitist politicians by reaching out to people who are less well-off:</p><blockquote>And to the memory of my grandfather, who taught me to look up to people others looked down on, because we’re not so different after all.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Bill Clinton, from the dedication in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Life_(Bill_Clinton_autobiography)' title='Wikipedia page for My Life' target='_blank'>My Life</a>, 2004.</blockquote><h4>Unconditional Positive Regard</h4><p>In Clinton's case though, this passion is objective, in that he considers everyone necessary and worthy of being cared for:</p><blockquote>And so we must say to every American: Look beyond the stereotypes that blind us.
