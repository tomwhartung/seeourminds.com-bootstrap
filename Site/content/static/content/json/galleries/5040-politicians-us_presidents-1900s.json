We are not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall be so handled as to subserve the public good. We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth.</blockquote><p>And although <a href='/image/0500-real-famous/0509/' title='Spiritual portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt on this site' target='_blank'>Eleanor</a> lived to be 78, both TR and FDR died in their early 60s, and experienced a great deal of physical pain their final years.

No father and mother can hope to escape sorrow and anxiety, and there are dreadful moments when death comes very near those we love, even if for the time being it passes by.
