      "story_html": "<p>Both Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt are ESTJs, but there are some subtle yet important differences in their personalities.</p><h4>TR: More Emotional Than FDR</h4><p>There is more Red in Theodore's spiritual portrait than there is in his <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Spiritual portrait of Franklin Roosevelt on this site' target='_blank'> cousin FDR's image</a>.  This is because TR's personality profile is more decisive and emotional (less <q>Thinking</q>) than his cousin.</p><p>Above all, Theodore admired &mdash; and demonstrated &mdash; courage.<blockquote>It is not the critic who counts. ... The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; whose face is marred by the dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly ... who, at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory or defeat.</blockquote><p>While campaigning for president in 1912, a man <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do89pViPkvU' title='Video about Theodore being shot on youtube.com' target='_blank'>shot Theodore</a>, but TR carried on and delived the 90-minute speech he had planned nonetheless.  Doctors later learned what TR already knew &mdash; that there was no damage to his lung &mdash; and decided it would be preferable to leave the bullet inside his chest.</p><p>Like <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5006/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Andrew Jackson on this site'>Andrew Jackson</a>, Theodore Roosevelt carried a bullet inside his body for the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt#Assassination_attempt' title='Wikipedia page for TR, cued to section about this assassination attept' target='_blank'>rest of his life</a>.</p><h4>Plenty of Similarities</h4><p>Although they belonged to different political parties &mdash; TR was a Republican and FDR a Democrat &mdash; both were concerned that the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few could lead to the exploitation of average citizens:</p><blockquote>Our aim is not to do away with corporations; on the contrary, these big aggregations are an inevitable development of modern industrialism. ... We are not hostile to them; we are merely determined that they shall be so handled as to subserve the public good. We draw the line against misconduct, not against wealth.</blockquote> <p>And both Presidents Roosevelt experienced a great deal of physical pain their final years, dying while still fairly young, in their early 60s.  Quoting from his autobiography, published in 1913, it is plain he had no regrets:</p><blockquote>It is impossible to win the great prizes of life without running risks, and the greatest of all prizes are those connected with the home. No father and mother can hope to escape sorrow and anxiety, and there are dreadful moments when death comes very near those we love, even if for the time being it passes by. But life is a great adventure, and the worst of all fears is the fear of living.</blockquote><p>For more TR quotes, see his <a href='https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt' title='Wikiquote page for Theodore Roosevelt' target='_blank'>page at wikiquote.org</a>.</p><hr /><p>It was easy creating Theodore Roosevelt's personality profile.

The horror of it made an impression that would affect him for the rest of his life.</p><h4>Decisive Debater</h4><p>As a student at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College' title='Wikipedia page for Davidson College' target='_blank'>Davidson College</a> in North Carolina, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University' title='Wikipedia page for Princeton University' target='_blank'>Princeton University</a> in New Jersey, and at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia_School_of_Law' title='Wikipedia page for The University of Virginia School of Law' target='_blank'>University of Virginia School of Law</a>, Woodrow studied history, philosophy and law, and enjoyed debating.</p><p>Woodrow's decisiveness, and his ability to reason clearly and debate passionately, is evident in the ample amount of Green and the substantial amount of Red in his spiritual portrait.  It's obvious he would have made a formidable debater.</p><h4>American Idealist</h4><p>Wilson also considered himself to be an idealist, and considered idealism to be an essential part of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the United States of America' target='_blank'>America</a> and being an American.  This idealism is evident in the Blue in his spiritual portrait.</p><blockquote>Sometimes people call me an idealist. Well, that is the way I know I am an American. America, my fellow citizens - I do not say it in disparagement of any other great people - America is the only idealistic Nation in the world.</blockquote><p>Woodrow's idealism and his first-hand experience with war as a child caused him to be reluctant to allow the US to enter <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I' title='Wikipedia page for World War I' target='_blank'>World War I</a> and look for a peaceful solution instead.  This stance helped him <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1916' title='Wikipedia page for the United States presidential election in 1916' target='_blank'>win re-election in 1916</a>.</p><h4>World War I and WW's Fourteen Points</h4><p>After Germany sank several American merchant ships, and then England intercepted the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram' title='Wikipedia page for Zimmermann Telegram' target='_blank'>Zimmermann Telegram</a>, sent by Germany to Mexico, Woodrow abandoned his anti-war stance, and appealed to Congress to declare war.  Congress did so on <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1917)' title='Wikipedia page for the United States declaration of war on Germany' target='_blank'>April 2, 1917</a>.</p><p>Woodrow Wilson's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilsonianism' title='Wikipedia page for Wilsonianism' target='_blank'>idealism</a> persisted, however, and when America entered the war he gave a speech to Congress known as the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen_Points' title='Wikipedia page for the Fourteen Points' target='_blank'>Fourteen Points</a>.  This speech outlines the way to a lasting peace, and the last of the Fourteen Points calls for the creation of an association of nations.</p><h4>Attempts to Prevent World War II</h4><p>He then sought to implement the last of these Fourteen Points and prevent future wars by working to create the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/League_of_Nations' title='Wikipedia page for the League of Nations' target='_blank'>League of Nations</a>.  He was convinced that this organization was the key to preventing another war that would be even worse the World War I.</p><blockquote>I can predict with absolute certainty that within another generation there will be another world war if the nations of the world do not concert the method by which to prevent it.</blockquote><p>Ultimately Congress refused to consent to America joining the League, claiming the United States needed to maintain its independence from external influences.  Although he was very disappointed in this, Woodrow won the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize' title='Wikipedia page for the Nobel Peace Prize' target='_blank'>Nobel Peace Prize</a> in 1919 for his efforts.</p><h4>WW Versus TR</h4><p>It is interesting to compare Woodrow's spiritual portrait with that of <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5040/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Theodore Roosevelt on this site'>Theodore Roosevelt</a>.  Both were very decisive, but TR frequently criticized Woodrow for opposing Ameria's entry into World War I.</p><p>Their decisiveness is evident in the large amounts of Green and Red in both portraits.  The difference between them is also evident, the Yellow in TR's image showing his obvious desire for immediate action, ane the Blue in WW's image showing his underlying idealism.</p><hr /><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the <a href='http://www.pbs.org/show/american-experience/' title='Link to the American Experience page at pbs.org' target='_blank'>American Experience</a> documentary, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307674/' title='Page for Woodrow Wilson and the Birth of the American Century on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Woodrow Wilson and the Birth of the American Century</a>.</p>",

This idealism is exemplified in what may well be his most famous quote, from his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy' title='Wikipedia page for the inauguration address delivered by JFK' target='_blank'>inauguration address</a>:</p><blockquote>Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country.</blockquote><p>After the last two democratic presidents, <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of FDR on this site'>FDR</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman' title='Wikipedia page for Harry S.

He chose to make it obvious right from the start that he knew there was no way he could take on the challenges he faced and do the job felt needed doing all by himself.</p><h4>Keeping a Cool Head</h4><p>Kennedy's challenges started early in his administration.  The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion' title='Wikipedia page for the Bay of Pigs Invasion' target='_blank'>Bay of Pigs Invasion</a> in April of 1961 taught him that rushing into action &mdash; even with the approval of experienced and trusted advisors &mdash; could have disasterous consequences.</p><p>Although plans for the invation were initiated by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower' title='Wikipedia page for Dwight D. Eisenhower' target='_blank'>Eisenhower</a> administration, and the operation was overseen and run by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency' title='Wikipedia page for the Central Intelligence Agency' target='_blank'>Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA), Kennedy took full responsibility for its failure.  This is remarkable when compared to some politicians in today's political climate.</p><p>The Bay of Pigs fiasco turned out to be only the first of many challenges he had to face.  With his fairly strong preference for being rational, was able to keep his cool through the worst of them &mdash; at least in public, if not always in private.</p><h4>Balancing Perception and Decisiveness</h4><p>JFK's personality profile shows his preference for perceiving over judging is very slight.  As the following quote demonstrates, he realized it is important to find the correct balance between acting too soon and not acting at all.</p><blockquote>There are risks and costs to action.

The backlash he feared became real, and is obvious in the results of the next several presidential elections.</p><h4>Paying the Political Price</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1964' title='Wikipedia page for the 1964 presidential election' target='_blank'>1964 presidential election</a> LBJ won 44 out of 50 states, with five of the six he lost &mdash; LA, MS, AL, GA, and SC &mdash; being in the deep south.  It also led to the southern states abandoning the Democratic party in the next few presidential elections, until the southerner <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1976' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Presidential election in 1976' target='_blank'>Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford in 1976</a>.</p><p>Learning about Lyndon B.

You got to listen to people.  It doesn't come so easy to me that this is right and that's wrong.  It's never that simple.

Johnson</a> contain more Green &mdash; which represents their objectivity, and Yellow &mdash; which represents their pragmatism.  These similarities in their temperaments help explain how &mdash; despite the differences in their respective political parties &mdash; their experiences with respect to the Civil Rights issue followed similar courses.</p><p>Both were pragmatic enough to realize that being in favor of extending Civil Rights to African Americans in a Texas that was staunchly opposed to these rights would be politically disasterous.  So during their campaigns they felt the purely political need to oppose this sort of legislation.</p><p>Once they won their elections, as civil rights activists like <a href='http://www.thekingcenter.org/about-dr-king' title='Link to an article about Martin Luther King at www.thekingcenter.org' target='_blank'>Martin Luther King</a> brought more attention to the issue, both Bush and Johnson realized that changing their stance on the issue was the right thing to do.</p><h4>Road to the White House</h4><p>In the 1970s, George H. W. Bush's career took him from Congress through stints at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations' title='Wikipedia page for the United Nations' target='_blank'>United Nations</a>, as an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_embassy#China_and_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for the de facto embassy in China' target='_blank'>Envoy to China</a>, and as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Central_Intelligence' title='Wikipedia page for the position of Director of the Central Intelligence Agency' target='_blank'>Director of the Central Intelligence Agency</a>.</p><p>During the Presidential campaign in 1980, Bush initially ran against <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Ronald Reagan' target='_blank'>Ronald Reagan</a>.  However, after falling behind Reagan in the Republican primary elections, Bush accepted his offer to run as his Vice President.</p><p>Interestingly, it was not a Democrat but actually Bush who coined the term <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaganomics' title='Wikipedia page for Reaganomics, aka. voodoo economics' target='_blank'>voodoo economics</a></q> in reference to Reagan's economic ideas during this campaign.

W. Bush as his Vice President, Bush ran for president in 1988.  It was during the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Republican_National_Convention' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican Convention in 1988' target='_blank'>Republican Convention</a> that Bush announced his infamous pledge of <q>No new taxes.</q></p><h4>President George Herbert Walker Bush</h4><p>At the urging of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Atwater#1988_election' title='Wikipedia page for ' target='_blank'>Lee Atwater</a>, his campaign manager, Bush reluctantly resorted to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_campaigning' title='Wikipedia page for negative campaigning, aka. mudslinging ' target='_blank'>mudslinging </a> &mdash; specifically by running the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolving_Door_(advertisement)' title='Wikipedia page for the revolving door ads' target='_blank'>revolving door ads</a> about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Horton' title='Wikipedia page for Willie Horton' target='_blank'>Willie Horton</a>.  The aggressive tactics worked, and Bush <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1988' title='Wikipedia page for the United States presidential election in 1988' target='_blank'>soundly defeated</a> his opponent <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis' title='Wikipedia page for Michael Dukakis' target='_blank'>Michael Dukakis</a>, carrying 40 of the 50 states and winning 53.4% of the popular vote.</p><p>Certainly one the most significant events occuring during his presidency is the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall#Fall_of_the_Berlin_Wall' title='Wikipedia page for the Berlin_Wall, cued to the part of the page about its fall' target='_blank'>fall of the Berlin Wall</a>.  True to his very cool, objective temperament, Bush's response was understated and unemotional:</p><blockquote> George H.W. Bush: Well, I don't think any single event is the end of what you might call the Iron Curtain, but clearly this is a long way from the harsh days of the harshest Iron Curtain days.  A long way from that.<br />Reporter: You know, in what you just said, that this is a sort of great victory, but you don't seem elated, and I'm wondering if you're thinking.<br />George H.W.

Compared to the powerful statements of previous presidents &mdash; specifically John F. Kennedy's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ich_bin_ein_Berliner' title='Wikipedia page for the Ich bin ein Berliner speech' target='_blank'>Ich bin ein Berliner speech</a> in 1963 and Ronald Reagan's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_down_this_wall!' title='Wikipedia page for the Tear Down This Wall speech' target='_blank'><q>Tear Down This Wall!</q> speech</a> in 1987, Bush felt any sort of self-aggrandizing would be inappropriate, and ultimately everything he said fell flat.</p><p>Of course, it is Bush's character and temperament that sets him apart from his predecessors:</p><blockquote>I am not one who flamboyantly believes in throwing a lot of words around.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From the <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=sELVAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage' title='Link to the Public Papers of George Bush at books.google.com' target='_blank'>Public Papers of George Bush</a>, August 11, 1990.</blockquote><p>George Bush's extremely high preference for objectivity &mdash; represented by the large amount of Green in his spiritual portrait &mdash; shows he is less comfortable than most when it comes to displaying emotion.  And ultimately his pragmatism &mdash; represented by the Yellow &mdash; made it impossible for him to keep his campaign promise of <q>No new taxes.</q></p><p>Undoubtedly this pragmatism and lack of emotion contributed to his defeat by <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5078/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Bill Clinton on this site'>Bill Clinton</a> in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1992' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election of 1992' target='_blank'>presidential election of 1992</a>.</p><h4>Looking Back</h4><p>The 1980s saw the rise of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television_in_the_United_States' title='Wikipedia page for cable television in the United States' target='_blank'>cable television</a> and the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_news_cycle' title='Wikipedia page for the 24-hour news cycle' target='_blank'>24-hour news cycle</a>.  Many people believe this trend &mdash; subsequently exacerbated by the free-for-all of the internet &mdash; has led to a decline in journalistic standards and the extreme opinions found in today's political environment.</p><p>In an interview granted to Michael Duffy in 2011, George H. W. Bush puts this trend in an historical perspective:</p><blockquote>Michael Duffy: You used to say, <q>The American people didn't send us here to bicker.</q>  Why can't the two parties compromise anymore?<br />George H. W. Bush: Everybody does seem a little more entrenched these days. But if you read David McCullough's great biographies of Washington or Adams, you find out they were pretty entrenched then too. People forget that Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr had a shoot-out over policy differences. I think the 24-hour news cycle has helped exaggerate the differences between the parties. You can always find someone on TV somewhere carping about something. That didn't happen 20 years ago.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2068093,00.html' title='Link to an article entitled 10 Questions for George H.W.

Bush</a> in <a href='http://time.com/' title='Link to the home page at Time.com' target='_blank'>Time</a> magazine, April 28, 2011.</blockquote><p>Many things have changed in the 20-plus years since Bush left office, and many more have changed in the 200-plus years since Washington and Adams.</p><p>But the interplay of the archetypes Carl Jung wrote about 100 years ago continues, in many ways very much the same as it ever has.</p><hr /><h4>About This Image</h4><p>When I wrote the original version of the Groja &copy; program in the late 1980s, sometimes I would get with some friends and we would answer the questions in the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, guessing how famous people would answer them.  I used the results of one of these exercises to create this portrait of George H. W. Bush.</p><p>It's interesting that this profile shows Bush's <q>T</q>hinking score to be 100% &mdash; implying he has no <q>F</q>eeling.  This was certainly the image he felt he needed to project at that time.</p><p>The <a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/bush/#part01' title='Link to the American Experience video at pbs.org' target='_blank'>American Experience video</a> &mdash; which played a significant part in the story for this image &mdash; concludes with a chapter about George Bush <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lkPXVnZAis' title='Video of crying on youtube.com' target='_blank'>crying</a> in 2006 while talking about his son, Jeb.

He served two full terms as President, the maximum allowed, and was the first Democrat to do so since <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5048' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Franklin D. Roosevelt on this site'>Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, whose held the office from 1933 through 1945.</p><h4>Very Slight Preferences</h4><p>Bill Clinton's preferences are very slight, making his spiritual portrait very colorful.  This versatility makes it difficult to pin him down and gives him resiliency when faced with opposition and other obstacles.</p><p>While his opponents liked to call him <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=slick%20willy' title='Link to the term Slick Willie at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>Slick Willie</a>, Clinton would be the first to admit that he makes mistakes but &mdash; unlike more decisive, <q>stronger</q> politicians &mdash; also learns from them.</p><blockquote>If you live long enough, you'll make mistakes.  But if you learn from them, you'll be a better person.  It's how you handle adversity, not how it affects you.  The main thing is never quit, never quit, never quit.<br /><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/us/1992-campaign-reporter-s-notebook-clinton-enjoying-mystery-over-choice-for.html' title='Link to an article about Bill Clinton at www.nytimes.com' target='_blank'>Speech, 1992</a>.</blockquote><p>While certainly most everyone is capable of realizing they've made a mistake, not everyone is sufficiently humble to learn from them, and fewer still have the capacity to actually change.</p><h4>Ex-Governor Clinton Rebounds</h4><p>After Clinton's first term of Governor of Arkansas, he lost his bid for re-election in 1980.  True to his character, he examined what he did wrong &mdash; <q>precinct by precinct</q> &mdash; and won his bid for re-election in 1982.</p><p>One major result of his analysis of what went wrong was he tried to do too much.  So during his later terms he worked to focus on key issues, such as education.</p><p>As a result, he was re-elected a total of three times and served for another ten years.  (The term length for Governors in Arkansas was increased from two to four years in 1986.)</p><p>With this ability to learn, grow and recover from setbacks, Clinton gave himself the nickname <q><a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comeback_kid' title='Link to definition of comeback kid at en.wiktionary.org' target='_blank'>the comeback kid</a>.</q></p><h4>A Preference for Idealism</h4><p>Bill Clinton's preferences may be slight, but they are very real.</p><p>His profile reflects a preference for idealism over pragmatism, and his spiritual portrait shows this by containing more Blue than Yellow.</p><p>As a teenager, Clinton gratefully seized on the opportunity to meet <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5058' title='Link to spiritual portrait of John F. Kennedy on this site'>John F. Kennedy</a> in 1963.  The young, idealistic President appealed to Clinton's nascent idealism and helped solidify his growing desire to run for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration' title='Wikipedia page for public administration' target='_blank'>public office</a> when he got older.</p><p>The following quote is an example showing Clinton's hopes and dreams for a better future, not just for the short term but for long after his term has ended:</p><blockquote>A hundred years from tonight, another American president will stand in this place and report on the State of the Union. He - or she - he or she will look back on a 21st century shaped in so many ways by the decisions we make here and now. So let it be said of us then that we were thinking not only of our time, but of their time; that we reached as high as our ideals; that we put aside our divisions and found a new hour of healing and hopefulness; that we joined together to serve and strengthen the land we love.<br /><a href='https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/New/html/19990119-2656.html' title='Link to State of the Union Address at ' target='_blank'>State of the Union Address</a> January 19, 1999.</blockquote> <p></p> <h4>A Preference for Passion</h4> <p>Bill Clinton's profile also reflects a preference for passion over objectivity, and his spiritual portrait shows this by containing more Red than Green.</p> <p>Infamous for his marital indescretions, this tendency to be more emotional than logical also shows up in how he can connect emotionally with voters.</p> <p></p> <h4></h4> <p></p> <p></p> <blockquote> Narrator: It was a politics of the possible, not the things he dreamed of doing, but the things he could do.<br /> <a href='http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/clinton/#part01' title='Link to the American Experience video about Bill Clinton at pbs.org' target='_blank'>American Experience video</a>.  </blockquote> <p></p> <blockquote>Profound and powerful forces are shaking and remaking our world.

David Keirsey <a href='http://www.keirsey.com/4temps/bill_clinton.asp' title='Page on keirsey.com claiming Bill Clinton is an ESFP' target='_blank'>claims he is an ESFP</a> while <a href='https://www.babble.com/entertainment/16-celebrity-myers-briggs-personality-types/' title='Article claiming Bill Clinton is an ESFJ' target='_blank'>this article at babble.com</a> claims he is an ESFJ.

But I thought he was <q>verified as an ENFP!?!</q></p><p>This is clearly a controversial issue, and it makes me think that not everyone conforms to a single personality type 100% of the time.  I, for one, consider myself to be extremely flexible and I enjoy fitting into different roles as the situation warrants it.</p><p>Some people change as they age, and some people like to exercise their flexibility and choose to use the abilities most suited for our current environment.  And as a matter of fact, I tend to do both!  However introspection and mindfulness over the years has led me to think I am most comfortable being an INFP.</p><p>It is entirely possible that Bill has equal, or nearly equal, preferences when it comes to choosing between pairs of opposites.  As the scales that accompany each image show &ndash; except for those that are based on just the four-letter-type, and hence use fixed percentages, of course &ndash; some people have stronger preferences than others.</p><p>In my experience, this is entirely reasonable and not at all uncommon.  This is why I emphasize it when presenting images that are 'generic,' due to having only the four-letter-type available.</p><p>And this image, being based on a four-letter-type, is one of those images of a 'generic' personality, that as a result uses fixed percentages.</p>",
