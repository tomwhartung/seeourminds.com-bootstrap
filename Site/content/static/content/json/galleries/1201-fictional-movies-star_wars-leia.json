      "explain_dom": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Leia's dominant personality trait, her very slight preference for logic over emotion.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Leia demonstrates her decisiveness in the way she asserts command after Obi-Wan, Luke, Han, and Chewbacca rescue her from Darth Vader in the original Star Wars, A New Hope.",
      "explain_aux": "The Blue in this spiritual portrait represents Leia's auxiliary personality trait, her very slight preference for ideas over facts.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  Leia demonstrates her openness to ideas when she senses Luke is in trouble after his fight with Darth Vader at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, and insists they interrupt their escape to return to get him.",

      "story_intro_html": "<p>When the original trilogy starts, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa' title='Wookieepedia page for Princess Leia' target='_blank'>Leia Organa</a> is Princess of the planet <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alderaan' title='Wookieepedia page for Alderaan' target='_blank'>Alderaan</a>, a Senator, and part of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic' title='Wookieepedia page for Rebel Alliance' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a>.</p><p>In one of the first scenes in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, Leia has obtained the plans for the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star' title='Wookieepedia page for the Death Star' target='_blank'>Death Star</a>, a weapon the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a> can use to destroy an entire planet.  Her Rebel Alliance spaceship is under attack from a much larger Empire spaceship, and she is desperate.</p> <h4>A Little Thing Called <q>Hope</q></h4><p>Princess Leia gives the detailed plans for the Empire's Death Star &mdash; which are invaluable to the efforts of the resistance &mdash; to her trustworthy droid <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/R2-D2' title='Wookieepedia page for R2-D2' target='_blank'>R2-D2</a>, along with her plea.  She instructs R2-D2 to deliver the message to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi' title='Wookieepedia page for Obi-Wan Kenobi' target='_blank'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, and while the Empire's stormtroopers capture the Princess, R2-D2 escapes to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tatooine/Legends' title='Wookieepedia page for Tatooine' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a> with <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/C-3PO' title='Wookieepedia page for C-3PO' target='_blank'>C-3PO</a>, a protocol droid who's become R2's sidekick.</p><p>On Tatooine, Luke Skywalker buys both droids from some <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jawa' title='Wookieepedia page for Jawas' target='_blank'>Jawas</a> and, while he's cleaning R2-D2, the droid plays the ending of Princess Leia's holo-message:</p><blockquote>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Luke helps R2-D2 deliver Princess Leia's holo-message to Obi-Wan, and they decide to leave Tatooine to help her.  They hire <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Han_Solo' title='Wookieepedia page for Han Solo' target='_blank'>Han Solo</a> and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chewbacca' title='Wookieepedia page for Chewbacca' target='_blank'>Chewbacca</a> &mdash; pilot and copilot of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon' title='Wookieepedia page for Millennium Falcon' target='_blank'>Millennium Falcon</a> &mdash; to help them, and leave Tatooine in the star ship just as the Empire's stormtroopers finally close in on them.</p> <h4>Leia, the Decider</h4><p>Princess Leia's spiritual portrait is more colorful than most because her preferences are very slight.  This means she is a very versatile, flexible, likeable person who can get along well with most people.</p><p>The Princess is, however, a bit more decisive than most.  When the attempt to rescue her leads to a close call with a trash compactor, followed by a sexist comment from one of her rescuers, she doesn't hesitate to take charge:</p><blockquote>Han Solo: If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.<br />Luke Skywalker: Well, let's get moving.  [An alarm sounds.]<br />Chewbacca: [Howls and runs away.]<br />Han: Where are you going?  Ahhh.  [Picks up his blaster.]<br />Princess Leia: No wait - they'll hear!<br />Han: [Fires his blaster.] Come here, you big coward!  Chewie, come here!<br />Princess Leia: I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you'll do as I tell you, ok?<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>As expected, Han takes exception to this command from <q>your worshipfulness,</q> and so their constant bickering begins.  They eventually manage to escape, though, aboard the Millenium Falcon.</p> <h4>Leia, the Unbreakable</h4><p>The most prominent color in Princess Leia's spiritual portrait is Green, representing her slight preference for making logical decisions.  Her portrait also contains quite a bit of Red, indicating she sometimes likes to rely on her feelings when making decisions.</p><p>Sentenced to death for supporting the Rebel alliance, Leia is brought before <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Vader' title='Wikipedia page for Darth Vader' target='_blank'>Darth Vader</a> and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin' title='Wikipedia page for Grand Moff Tarkin' target='_blank'>Grand Moff Tarkin</a>.  They hope to get her to reveal what she did with the Death Star's plans by threatening to destroy her home planet of <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alderaan' title='Wikipedia page for Alderaan' target='_blank'>Alderaan</a>.</p><blockquote>Grand Moff Tarkin: Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.<br />Leia: No!  Alderaan is peaceful!  We have no weapons!  You can't possibly &mdash;<br />Tarkin: Will you provide another target, a military target?  Then name the system!  I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.  Where is the rebel base?<br />Leia: Dantooine.  They're on Dantooine.<br />Tarkin: There.  You see Lord Vader?  She can be reasonable.  Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.<br />Leia: What?!?<br />Tarkin: You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration but don't worry, we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Significantly, Leia did not cry when Grand Moff Tarkin destroyed her home planet.  From a logical point of view, a display of emotion would not have helped anything, and she did not want to give them the pleasure of seeing her break.</p> <h4>Leia, the Idealist</h4> <p>Very slight preference.  Less idealistic than Luke &mdash; did not receive Jedi training in the movies, so felt the kinship after he did &mdash; but more idealistic than Han.</p> <blockquote>Han: I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.<br />Leia: He wasn't.  I can feel it.<br />Han: You love him, don't you?<br />Leia: Yes.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983.</blockquote> <p> </p> <h4>Leia and Han: Opposites Attract</h4> <p>The the responsible one and <q>scoundrel.</q></p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> </p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the Star Wars <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the original trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a>:</p><ul><li>Episode IV: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977</li><li>Episode V: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980</li><li>Episode VI: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983</li></ul><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
