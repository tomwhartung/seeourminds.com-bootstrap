In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Leia demonstrates her decisiveness in the way she asserts command after Obi-Wan, Luke, Han, and Chewbacca rescue her from Darth Vader in the original Star Wars, A New Hope.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  Leia demonstrates her openness to ideas when she senses Luke is in trouble after his fight with Darth Vader at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, and insists they interrupt their escape to return to get him.",

      "story_intro_html": "<p>When the original trilogy starts, <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa' title='Wookieepedia page for Princess Leia' target='_blank'>Leia Organa</a> is Princess of the planet <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alderaan' title='Wookieepedia page for Alderaan' target='_blank'>Alderaan</a>, a Senator, and part of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic' title='Wookieepedia page for Rebel Alliance' target='_blank'>Rebel Alliance</a>.</p><p>As <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a> starts, Leia has obtained the plans for the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star' title='Wookieepedia page for the Death Star' target='_blank'>Death Star</a>, a weapon the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Galactic_Empire' title='Wookieepedia page for the Galactic Empire' target='_blank'>Galactic Empire</a> can use to destroy an entire planet.  Her Rebel Alliance spaceship is under attack from a much larger Empire spaceship, and she is desperate.</p><h4>A Little Thing Called <q>Hope</q></h4><p>Princess Leia gives the detailed plans for the Empire's Death Star &mdash; which are invaluable to the efforts of the resistance &mdash; to her trustworthy droid <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/R2-D2' title='Wookieepedia page for R2-D2' target='_blank'>R2-D2</a>, along with a holo-message containing her plea.  She instructs R2-D2 to deliver the message to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi' title='Wookieepedia page for Obi-Wan Kenobi' target='_blank'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>, and while the Empire's stormtroopers capture the Princess, R2-D2 escapes to <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tatooine/Legends' title='Wookieepedia page for Tatooine' target='_blank'>Tatooine</a> with <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/C-3PO' title='Wookieepedia page for C-3PO' target='_blank'>C-3PO</a>, a protocol droid who's become R2's sidekick.</p><p>On Tatooine, Luke Skywalker buys both droids from some <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jawa' title='Wookieepedia page for Jawas' target='_blank'>Jawas</a> and, while he's cleaning R2-D2, the droid plays the ending of Princess Leia's holo-message:</p><blockquote>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.  You're my only hope.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Luke helps R2-D2 deliver Princess Leia's holo-message to Obi-Wan, and they decide to leave Tatooine to help her.  They hire <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Han_Solo' title='Wookieepedia page for Han Solo' target='_blank'>Han Solo</a> and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Chewbacca' title='Wookieepedia page for Chewbacca' target='_blank'>Chewbacca</a> &mdash; pilot and copilot of the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon' title='Wookieepedia page for Millennium Falcon' target='_blank'>Millennium Falcon</a> &mdash; to take them to her, and leave Tatooine in the star ship just as the Empire's stormtroopers close in on them.</p><h4>Leia, the Decider</h4><p>Princess Leia's spiritual portrait is more colorful than most because her preferences are very slight.  This means she is a very versatile, flexible, likeable person who can get along well with most people.</p><p>The Green and Red in Leia's portrait shows the Princess is, however, a bit more decisive than most.  When the attempt to rescue her leads to a close call with a trash compactor, followed by a sexist comment from one of her rescuers, she doesn't hesitate to take charge:</p><blockquote>Han Solo: If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able to get out of here.<br />Luke Skywalker: Well, let's get moving.  [An alarm sounds.]<br />Chewbacca: [Howls and runs away.]<br />Han: Where are you going?  Ahhh.  [Picks up his blaster.]<br />Princess Leia: No wait - they'll hear!<br />Han: [Fires his blaster.] Come here, you big coward!  Chewie, come here!<br />Leia: <b>I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but from now on, you'll do as I tell you, ok?</b><br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.  [Emphasis added.]</blockquote><p>As one might expect, Han takes exception to this command from <q>your worshipfulness,</q> and so their constant bickering begins.  After exchanging blaster fire with the Empire's stormtroopers, they eventually manage to escape aboard the Millenium Falcon.</p><h4>Leia, the Unbreakable</h4><p>The most prominent color in Princess Leia's spiritual portrait is Green, representing her slight preference for making logical decisions.  Her portrait also contains quite a bit of Red, indicating she sometimes likes to rely on her feelings when making decisions.</p><p>The Empire has sentenced Leia to death for supporting the Rebel alliance, and she is brought before <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Darth_Vader' title='Wookieepedia page for Darth Vader' target='_blank'>Darth Vader</a> and <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Wilhuff_Tarkin' title='Wookieepedia page for Grand Moff Tarkin' target='_blank'>Grand Moff Tarkin</a>.  They hope that by threatening to destroy her home planet of <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Alderaan' title='Wookieepedia page for Alderaan' target='_blank'>Alderaan</a> they can get her to reveal what she did with the Death Star's plans.</p><blockquote>Grand Moff Tarkin: Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power on your home planet of Alderaan.<br />Princess Leia: No!  Alderaan is peaceful!  We have no weapons!  You can't possibly &mdash;<br />Tarkin: Will you provide another target, a military target?  Then name the system!  I grow tired of asking this, so it will be the last time.  Where is the rebel base?<br />Leia: <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Dantooine' title='Wookieepedia page for Dantooine' target='_blank'>Dantooine</a>.  They're on Dantooine.<br />Tarkin: There.  You see Lord Vader?  She can be reasonable.  Continue with the operation.  You may fire when ready.<br />Leia: What?!?<br />Tarkin: You're far too trusting.  Dantooine is too remote to make an effective demonstration but don't worry, we will deal with your rebel friends soon enough.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Tellingly, Leia did not cry when Grand Moff Tarkin destroyed her home planet.  As a logical decision maker, Leia knew a display of emotion would not have helped anything, and she did not want to give them the pleasure of seeing her break.</p><h4>Leia and the Force</h4><p>The Blue in Princess Leia's spiritual portrait represents her very slight preference for being idealistic.  Her portrait also contains quite a bit of Yellow, indicating she can be pragmatic when the situation calls for it.</p><p>Like other members of the Rebel Alliance, Leia embraces the ideals of peace and freedom.  They all also understand that obtaining these ideals requires pragmatic actions &mdash; fighting a war to win independence from the Galactic Empire's tyranny.</p><p>As Luke's twin sister, Leia too has inherited the <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian/Legends' title='Wookieepedia page for midi-chlorians' target='_blank'>midi-chlorians</a> that help make the Jedi special from her father, <a href='/image/1220-fictional-movies-star_wars-prequel/1222/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Anakin Skywalker on this site'>Anakin Skywalker</a>.  These microscopic life forms may be what enables her to connect with Luke <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Telepathy' title='Wookieepedia page for telepathy' target='_blank'>telepathically</a> &mdash; through her ideas.</p><blockquote>Princess Leia: You have a power.  I - I don't understand, and could never have.<br />Luke Skywalker: You're wrong, Leia.  You have that power, too.  In time, you'll learn to use it as I have.  The force is strong in my family.  My father has it, I have it, my sister has it.  Yes, it's you, Leia.<br />Leia: I know.  Somehow, I've always known.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983.</blockquote><p>Whether this is all part of how the force works, or what the midi-chlorians do, or is just part of being Luke's twin is hard to say.  It's plausible that two or all three of these factors are combining to contribute to the result.</p> <h4>Leia and Han's Innate Magnetism</h4> <p>Leia's preference for making logical decisions is the opposite of Han's preference for making emotional decisions, and Leia's preference for idealism is the opposite of Han's preference for pragmatism.  These opposites create a strong attraction, and the pair has a real <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_and_Diane' title='Wikipedia page for Sam and Diane of Cheers' target='_blank'>Sam and Diane</a> thing going on.</p> <p>Even more significantly, Leia is definitely more decisive while Han is much more perceptive.  She is a responsible politician and leader of the rebel alliance, while Han is the <q>scoundrel</q> &mdash; always on the lookout for an opportunity he can take advantage of.</p> <p>Most of Leia's and Han's preferences are fairly slight, but their spiritual portraits are strikingly different nonetheless.  The cool, heavy, serious Green and Blue in Leia's image contrasts sharply with the warm, open, easy-going Yellow and Red in Han's image.</p> <h4>Decisiveness/Lack of a Plan Difference </h4> <p> </p> <blockquote> Han Solo: I can't hold them off forever!  Now what?<br /> Leia: This is some rescue.  When you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?<br /> Han Solo: He's the brains, sweetheart!  What the hell are you doing?<br /> Leia: Somebody has to save our skins!  Into the garbage, fly boy!<br /> Han: Get in there!  Get in there you big furr ball!  I don't care what you smell!  [Kick's Chewbacca into the garbage chute.] Get in there and don't worry about it!  [To Luke:] Wonderful girl!  Either I'm gonna kill her or I'm beginning to like her!  Get in there!  [Luke jumps in and Han follows.]  Whoooo!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Episode IV: A New Hope, 1977 - 1:18:20.  </blockquote> <p> </p> <h4>Big Picture/Facts Difference</h4> <p> </p> <blockquote> Han Solo: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh?  You know, sometimes I amaze even myself.<br /> Leia: That doesn't sound too hard.  They let us go.  That's the only explanation for the ease of our escape.<br /> Han: Easy?  You call that easy?<br /> Leia: They're tracking us.<br /> Han: Not this ship, sister.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From Episode IV: A New Hope, 1977 - 1:36:42.  </blockquote> <p>Not sure whether it applies to the images, but it's a good quote.  Leia is trying to talk Han into staying to help, but Han thinks she's got a different, romantic motivation for asking him to stay: </p> <blockquote> Leia: You're imagining things.<br /> Han: Am I?  Then why are you following me?  Afraid I was going to leave without giving you a good-bye kiss?<br /> Leia: I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.<br /> Han: I can arrange that.  You could use a good kiss!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980 - 6:00.  </blockquote> <h4>Feeling/Thinking Difference</h4> <p> </p> <blockquote>Han: No time to discuss this in committee.<br /> Leia: I am not a committee!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980 - 1:00:20.  </blockquote> <p> </p> <blockquote> Han Solo: Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.<br /> Princess Leia: That's right.<br /> Han Solo: Well, don't get all mushy on me.  So long, Princess.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980 - 5:50.  </blockquote> <p>She's kind of mean sometimes, but Han takes it in stride: </p> <blockquote> Leia: Why - why you stuck up, half-witted, scruffy-looking, nerf-herder!<br /> Han: Who's scruffy-looking?!?  [To Luke.]  Must've hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?  <br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980 - 17:05.  </blockquote> <p>And the classic confession, awwww: </p> <blockquote> Leia: I love you.<br /> Han Solo: I know.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, 1980 - 1:36:00.  </blockquote> <p> </p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> </p> <blockquote>Han: I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.<br />Leia: He wasn't.  I can feel it.<br />Han: You love him, don't you?<br />Leia: Yes.<br />Han: All right.  I understand.  Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.<br />Leia: Oh.  No, it's not like that at all.  He's my brother.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Episode VI: Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983.</blockquote> <p> </p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the Star Wars <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the original trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a>:</p><ul><li>Episode IV: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977</li><li>Episode V: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980</li><li>Episode VI: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983</li></ul><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
