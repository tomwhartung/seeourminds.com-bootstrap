  "story_html": "<p>These three people make a good team.</p><p>The Blue in Luke's spiritual portrait shows that he, with his Jedi training, is the deep, idealistic one.

Her very versatile, well-rounded personality makes it very easy for almost everyone to like her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Yellow in Han's image shows he has the sharp awareness needed to support superior piloting skills, and the Red shows he is amiable and willing to help.  His pragmatism and emotion &mdash; represented by the Yellow and Red &mdash; are the opposite of Leia's idealism and logic &mdash; represented by the Blue and Green &mdash; fueling a strong attraction.</p><p>To learn more about a character's personality, click on their thumbnail to see a larger version, then click on the <b>Show the Whole Story</b> button to read the character's story.</p>",

      "explain_dom": "The Green in this spiritual portrait represents Leia's dominant personality trait, her very slight preference for logic over emotion.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Leia demonstrates her decisiveness in the way she asserts command after Obi-Wan, Luke, Han, and Chewbacca rescue her from Darth Vader in the original Star Wars, A New Hope.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  Leia demonstrates her openness to ideas when she senses Luke is in trouble after his fight with Darth Vader at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, and insists they interrupt their escape to return to get him.",
