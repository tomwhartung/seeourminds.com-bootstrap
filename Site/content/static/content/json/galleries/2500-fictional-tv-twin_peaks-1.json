      "story_intro_html": "<p>As the beautiful Homecoming Queen of Twin Peaks High School, Laura Palmer is popular and has every reason to be happy.  She has secrets, though &mdash; including multiple boyfriends and a <a href='https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/cocaine' title='Link to the page about cocaine at www.drugabuse.gov' target='_blank'>cocaine</a> habit.</p><h4>Life Is but a Dream</h4><p>Airing in 1990 and 1991, the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/' title='Page for the Twin Peaks television series on imdb.com' target='_blank'>television series</a> starts with Laura's death.  She is the main character in the movie, however &mdash; a prequel titled <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/' title='Page for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me on imdb.com' target='_blank'><em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</em></a>, released in 1992.</p><p>The iconic <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498247/' title='Page for Sheryl Lee on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Sheryl Lee</a> is excellent in the role, portraying Laura as a girl who has the world at her fingertips.  In the days before her murder, however, she is quickly losing touch with reality.</p><p>The Blue in Laura Palmer's portrait &mdash; representing her preference for ideas over facts &mdash; reveals this tendency.  And the following excerpt from a casual conversation with her best friend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hayward' title='Wikipedia page for Donna Hayward' target='_blank'>Donna Hayward</a> one lazy afternoon shows how she all too willing to let go of reality and drift into a world of fantasy:</p><blockquote>Donna: Do you think that if you were falling in space, that you would slow down after a while, or go faster and faster?<br />Laura: Faster and faster.  And for a long time, you wouldn't feel anything.  And then you'd burst into fire.  Forever.  And the angels wouldn't help you, because they've all gone away.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks:_Fire_Walk_With_Me' title='Wikipedia page for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' target='_blank'>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</a>, 1992.</blockquote><p>And in Laura's case, her imagination drifts into darker and darker places.</p><h4>That Fatalistic Feeling</h4><p>Because the film came out a year after the series ended, it is difficult to imagine a viewer who did not know the outcome of the movie before seeing it.  And naturally, as the movie progresses, the overriding sense of doom likewise becomes progressively more and more palpable.</p><p>One of the most uniquely <q>Lynchian</q> of these premonitions occurs when the inimitable <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Lady' title='Wikipedia page for the Log Lady' target='_blank'>Log Lady</a>, played by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183466/' title='Page for Catherine Coulson on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Catherine Coulson</a>, approaches Laura outside the <q>Bang Bang!</q> bar:</p><blockquote>[Puts her hand on Laura's forehead, as if to feel her temperature.]<br /><q>When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out.  The tender boughs of innocence burn first.  And the wind rises, and then, all goodness is in jeopardy.</q><br />[Allows her hand to drift downward to Laura's cheek, then down further to briefly hold her hand before releasing it and walking away.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278784/characters/nm0183466' title='Page for the Log Lady on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Log Lady</a> in <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/' title='Page for Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</a>, 1992.</blockquote><p>The Log Lady makes it plain that she does not need drugs to have a tenuous grip on reality.</p><h4>R.I.P. Laura Palmer</h4><p>In the television series, <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/characters/nm0338614' title='Page for James Hurley on imdb.com' target='_blank'>James Hurley</a> &mdash; one of Laura's boyfriends &mdash; tells the police about his last date with Laura, on the night she was killed.  The movie brings this scene to life:</p><blockquote>James: What the hell's wrong with you?<br />Laura: [Obviously high.]  That's right.  There's no place left to go, is there, James?<br />James: What the hell's that supposed to mean?<br />Laura: You know it, and I know it.<br />James: What's wrong with us?  We have everything.<br />Laura: Everything but everything.<br />James: Laura....<br />Laura: Right.  Open your eyes, James.  You don't even know me.  There are things about me, even Donna doesn't know me.  Your Laura disappeared.  It's just me now.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/' title='Page for Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me</a>, 1992.</blockquote><p>Laura's final hours are horrific, but they bring closure.</p><p>R.I.P.
