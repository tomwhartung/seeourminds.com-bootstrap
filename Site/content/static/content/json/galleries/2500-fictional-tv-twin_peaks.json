      "explain_dom": "The Blue in Laura Palmer's spiritual portrait represents her dominant personality trait, her preference for seeing the world in terms of ideas more than facts.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  She exhibits this trait in the way her conversations with others, especially her close friends and lovers, often take on a dreamy, surrealistic quality.",
      "explain_aux": "The Red in Laura Palmer's spiritual portrait represents her auxiliary personality trait, her passion and warmth.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  She exhibits this trait in the way she is friendly and popular with her friends, schoolmates, and other acquaintances.",

      "story_intro_html": "<p>As the beautiful Homecoming Queen of Twin Peaks High School, Laura Palmer is popular and has every reason to be happy.  She has secrets, though &mdash; including multiple boyfriends and a drug habit.</p><h4>Life Is but a Dream</h4><p>Airing in 1990 and 1991, the <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098936/' title='Page for the Twin Peaks television series on imdb.com' target='_blank'>television series</a> starts with Laura's death.  She is the main character in the movie, however &mdash; a prequel titled <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/' title='Page for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me on imdb.com' target='_blank'><em>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</em></a>, released in 1992.</p><p>The iconic <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0498247/' title='Page for Sheryl Lee on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Sheryl Lee</a> is excellent in the role, portraying Laura as the girl who has the world at her fingertips.  In the days before her murder, however, she is quickly losing touch with reality.</p><p>The Blue in her portrait &mdash; representing her preference for ideas over facts &mdash; shows this tendency.  And the following excerpt from a casual conversation with her best friend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Hayward' title='Wikipedia page for Donna Hayward' target='_blank'>Donna Hayward</a> one lazy afternoon shows how she doesn't hesitate to let go of reality and allow her mind to drift to fantasy:</p><blockquote>Donna: Do you think that if you were falling in space, that you would slow down after a while, or go faster and faster?<br />Laura: Faster and faster.  And for a long time, you wouldn't feel anything.  And then you'd burst into fire.  Forever.  And the angels wouldn't help you, because they've all gone away.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp; <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks:_Fire_Walk_With_Me' title='Wikipedia page for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' target='_blank'>Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me</a>, 1992.</blockquote><p>And in Laura's case, her imagination drifts into darker and darker places.</p><h4>Overriding Feeling of Fatalism</h4><p>Because the film came out a year after the series ended, it is difficult to imagine a viewer who did not know the outcome of the movie before seeing it.  And naturally, as the movie progresses, the overriding sense of fatalism likewise becomes progressively more and more palpable.</p><p>One of the most uniquely <q><em>Lynchian</em></q> of these premonitions occurs when the inimitable <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_Lady' title='Wikipedia page for the Log Lady' target='_blank'>Log Lady</a>, played by <a href='http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183466/' title='Page for Catherine Coulson on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Catherine Coulson</a>, approaches Laura outside the <q>Bang Bang!</q> bar:</p><blockquote>[Puts her hand on Laura's forehead, as if to feel her temperature.]<br />When this kind of fire starts, it is very hard to put out.  The tender boughs of innocence burn first.  And the wind rises, and then, all goodness is in jeopardy.<br />[Allows her hand to drift downward to Laura's cheek, then down further to briefly hold her hand before releasing it and walking away.]<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;The <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0278784/characters/nm0183466' title='Page for the Log Lady on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Log Lady</a> in Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, 1992.</blockquote> <p> </p> <h4> </h4> <p> </p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> </p> <p> </p><hr /> <p>This spiritual portrait is based on the movie <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105665/' title='Page for the movie Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Twin Peaks: Fire, Walk With Me</a>.</p>",
