In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  She exhibits this trait in the way her conversations with others, especially her close friends and lovers, often take on a dreamy, surrealistic quality.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.
