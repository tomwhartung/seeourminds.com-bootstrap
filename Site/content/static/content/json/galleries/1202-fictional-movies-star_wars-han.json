In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Han demonstrates this trait when he initially refuses to help Luke, Leia, and the Rebel Alliance in Star Wars IV, A New Hope, thinking that their fight against the Empire is not realistic, and that he has more important things to do than help his new friends in their mission.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  Han demonstrates this trait when he has a change of heart and decides to return to help Luke, Leia, and the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Empire, coming back to help destroy the Death Star near the ending in Star Wars IV, A New Hope.",

Listening to Han boasting to Obi-Wan, one might even call him a bit <q>cocky.</q></p><blockquote>Han Solo: You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?<br />Obi-Wan: No. Should I have?<br />Han Solo: It's the ship that made the Kessel Run in less than twelve <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Parsec' title='Wookieepedia page for parsecs' target='_blank'>parsecs</a>.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>When the responsible political leader <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Leia_Organa' title='Wookieepedia page for Princess Leia' target='_blank'>Princess Leia</a> meets him, she sees a scoundrel.  The opposites in their personalities begin working their mutual attraction magic &mdash; and sparks start flying.</p> <h4>Han, the Skeptical Realist</h4><p>Han Solo's spiritual portrait contains a lot of Yellow, representing his fairly strong preference for being practical and realistic.  In this respect he's the opposite of <a href='/image/1200-fictional-movies-star_wars-original/1200/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Luke Skywalker on this site'>Luke Skywalker</a>, who is more idealistic, and whose portrait contains a lot of Blue.</p><p>Riding in the Millenium Falcon on their way to Alderaan, Han watches Luke practicing with a light saber while Obi-Wan Kenobi teaches him about the force.  Han doesn't buy it:</p><blockquote>Han Solo: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.<br />Luke Skywalker: You don't believe in the force, do you?<br />Han: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other.  I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything.  There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.  It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote><p>Ignoring Han, Obi-Wan shows Luke how to use the force to predict and deflect the practice remote's firings even with his vision blocked.  The skeptical Han attributes Luke's success to <q>luck.</q></p> <h4>Romantic Tough-Guy</h4> <p>As a smuggler, Han Solo frequently has to deal with people who may be less than honorable.  Therefore, he needs to maintain a tough-guy image &mdash; at least in his own mind.</p> <p> </p> <blockquote>Han: Look, your worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight. I take orders from just one person: me.<br />Leia: Hmm. It's a wonder you're still alive. Will somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?<br />Han: No reward is worth this.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a> , 1980.</blockquote> <p>The two are constantly bickering, but at one point he reveals to Luke how he's really crushing on Leia.</p> <blockquote>Luke: I care.  So.  What do you think of her, Han?<br />Han: Trying not to, kid.<br />Luke: Good.<br />Han: Still, she's got a lot of spirit.  I don't know, what do you think?  Do you think a princess and a guy like me could &ndash;<br />Luke: No.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;From <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for Episode IV: A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Episode IV: A New Hope</a>, 1977.</blockquote> <p> </p> <h4>Han and Leia: Opposites Attract</h4> <p>The <q>scoundrel</q> and the logical, responsible one.</p> <p> </p> <blockquote> </blockquote> <p> </p> <hr /><h4>About This Portrait</h4><p>This spiritual portrait is based on the Star Wars <a href='http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Prequel_trilogy' title='Link to a page about the original trilogy at starwars.wikia.com' target='_blank'>original trilogy</a>:</p><ul><li>Episode IV: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/' title='Page for A New Hope on imdb.com' target='_blank'>A New Hope</a>, 1977</li><li>Episode V: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080684/' title='Page for The Empire Strikes Back imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Empire Strikes Back</a>, 1980</li><li>Episode VI: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086190/' title='Page for Return of the Jedi on imdb.com' target='_blank'>Return of the Jedi</a>, 1983</li><li>Episode VII: <a href='http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/' title='Page for The Force Awakens on imdb.com' target='_blank'>The Force Awakens</a>, 2015</li></ul><p>The book <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Psychology-Dark-Side-ebook/dp/B0751JBFXW/' title='Link to a page about Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Star Wars Psychology: The Dark Side of the Mind</a>, by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Travis-Langley/e/B006UXQOTC/' title='Link to a page about Travis Langley at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Travis Langley</a> and with a forward by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/Carrie-Goldman/e/B007GGNEWW/' title='Link to a page about Carrie Goldman at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Carrie Goldman</a>, was also helpful in creating these portraits.
