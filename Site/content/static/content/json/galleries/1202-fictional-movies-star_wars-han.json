  "story_html": "<p>These three people make a good team.</p><p>The Blue in Luke's spiritual portrait shows that he, with his Jedi training, is the deep, idealistic one.  His image looks very similar to <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1210/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Yoda on this site'>Yoda</a>'s and <a href='/image/1210-fictional-movies-star_wars-jedi_and_droids/1212/' title='Link to the spiritual portrait of Obi-Wan Kenobi on this site'>Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>'s.</p><p>The Green in Leia's spiritual portrait shows she is, by a small margin, the most decisive member of this group.  Her very versatile, well-rounded personality makes it very easy for almost everyone to like her.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Yellow in Han's image shows he has the sharp awareness needed to support superior piloting skills, and the Red shows he is amiable and willing to help.  His pragmatism and emotion &mdash; represented by the Yellow and Red &mdash; are the opposite of Leia's idealism and logic &mdash; represented by the Blue and Green &mdash; fueling a strong attraction.</p><p>To learn more about a character's personality, click on their thumbnail to see a larger version, then click on the <b>Show the Whole Story</b> button to read the character's story.</p>",

      "explain_dom": "The Yellow in this spiritual portrait represents Han's dominant personality trait, his realistic outlook and openness to new experiences.  In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  Han demonstrates this trait when he initially refuses to help Luke, Leia, and the Rebel Alliance in Star Wars IV, A New Hope, thinking that their fight against the Empire is not realistic, and that he has more important things to do than help his new friends in their mission.",
      "explain_aux": "The Red in this spiritual portrait represents Han's auxiliary personality trait, his amiability, warmth, and friendliness.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  Han demonstrates this trait when he has a change of heart and decides to return to help Luke, Leia, and the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Empire, coming back to help destroy the Death Star near the ending in Star Wars IV, A New Hope.",
