  "description_html": "<p>The image of Dukie's personality shows he is rather like his predecessors in the pit, D'Angelo and Wallace.  But where Wallace had D'Angelo and Dee had his uncle Avon, Dukie has no such support network.  Likewise, this image of Namond's personality shows he lacks the cold-hearted rationality his father Wee Bey has, and which is needed to survive on the show's drug corners.</p><p>Randy's portrait shows he's logical, open to trying new things, and has his fair share of ideas.  In contrast, the spiritual portrait of Michael shows he is very cold and decisive, effectively forced by his circumstances to grow up more quickly than the others.</p>",
