In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he told 11,345 striking air traffic controllers to return to work within 48 hours, and fired them when they refused to do so.",

In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this trait when he came up with the Stratigic Defense Initiative, in his deeply held Christian beliefs, and in the way he delegated many of the details in the day-to-workings of the White House to his subordinates.",
      "story_intro_html": "<p>Born in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampico,_Illinois' title='Wikipedia page for Tampico, Illinois' target='_blank'>Tampico, Illinois</a> on February 6, 1911, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Ronald Wilson Reagan' target='_blank'>Ronald Wilson Reagan</a> became the 40th President at the age of 69 in 1981.  Even though Reagan was born two years <em>before </em> <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon' title='Wikipedia page for Richard Nixon' target='_blank'>Richard Nixon</a>, he became president more than a decade <em>after</em> Nixon.</p><h4>Governor Reagan</h4><p>Before being elected President in 1980, Ronald Reagan served two terms as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California' title='Wikipedia page for Governor of California' target='_blank'>Governor of California</a>, from 1967 to 1975.</p><p>Entering office as the 33rd Governor of California, he replaced the 32nd Governor <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Brown' title='Wikipedia page for Pat Brown' target='_blank'>Pat Brown</a>, who had served two terms from 1959-1967.  After Reagan served his two terms, Pat's son <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown' title='Wikipedia page for Jerry Brown' target='_blank'>Jerry Brown</a> entered the office as the 34th Governor and also served two terms, from 1975-1983.</p><p>As the large amounts of Green in their spiritual portraits show, presidents Reagan and <a href='/image/5040-politicians-us_presidents-1900s/5062/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Richard Nixon on this site'>Nixon</a> had similar personalities.  And as the other colors show &mdash; Reagan's Blue as opposed to Nixon's Yellow in particular &mdash; there were differences.</p><h4>Anti-Communist, and Law-and-Order Candidate</h4><p>After serving first in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Reserve' title='Wikipedia page for the Army Reserve' target='_blank'>Army Reserve</a>, then later in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces' title='Wikipedia page for the Army Air Forces' target='_blank'>Army Air Forces</a> during <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a>, Reagan caught up in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare' title='Wikipedia page for the Red Scare' target='_blank'>anti-communist fervor</a> that prevailed in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  As President of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild' title='Wikipedia page for the Screen Actors Guild' target='_blank'>Screen Actors Guild</a> from 1947 through 1959, Reagan's politics caused him to lose <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyman' title='Wikipedia page for Jane Wyman' target='_blank'>his first wife</a> and meet <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Nancy Reagan' target='_blank'>his second one</a> in 1949.</p><p>In 1969 Ronald Reagan was Governor of California during the violent <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park_(Berkeley)#May_15,_1969:_&quot;Bloody_Thursday&quot;' title='Wikipedia page for the protests at Peoples Park in Berkeley, cued to the section about Bloody Thursday on May 15, 1969' target='_blank'>protests at People's Park</a> in Berkeley.  As his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Richard Nixon did when running for President in 1968, Reagan leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate in his campaign for re-election in 1970.</p><h4>Peacemaker</h4><p>Ronald Reagan's anti-communist, law-and-order stance does not imply he was an enemy of peace.</p><p>As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, Ronald Reagan preferred logic to emotion.  So although both he and the protesters wanted peace, he differed from them in that he was not inclined to get all emotional about it.</p><blockquote>I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan, in his <a href='http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-28-1980-debate-transcript' title='Link to the presidential debate between Reagan and Carter at www.debates.org' target='_blank'>presidential debate</a> with Jimmy Carter, October 28, 1980.</blockquote><p>In the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY' title='Video of A Time for Choosing on youtube.com' target='_blank'><em>A Time for Choosing</em></a> speech Reagan gave supporting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater' title='Wikipedia page for Barry Goldwater' target='_blank'>Barry Goldwater</a> in 1964, he quotes <a href='/image/4900-politicians-founding_fathers/4903/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'>Alexander Hamilton</a>, Patrick Henry, and Winston Churchill in explaining that Goldwater desired not just peace, but <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/04/text-of-goldwaters-speech-formally-opening-presidential-campaign.html' title='Link to the text of Goldwaters speech formally opening his presidential campaign at www.nytimes.com' target='_blank'>peace through strength</a>.</p><h4>Crisis: Iran-Contra</h4><p>In the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1984' title='Wikipedia page for the presidential election of 1984' target='_blank'>presidential election of 1984</a>, Ronald Reagan carried all but one state.  Like many other two-term presidents, he fell prey to the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-term_curse' title='Wikipedia page for the alleged curse on the second term of presidents' target='_blank'>second-term curse</a>, a superstition that may betray a tendency towards <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias' title='Wikipedia page for confirmation bias' target='_blank'>confirmation bias</a>.  In Reagan's case, the <q>curse</q> did indeed <q>come true,</q> at least to a certain extent.</p><p>Ronald Reagan believed the forces behind democracy and freedom were stronger than those behind communism and tyranny.  In a <a href='http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=38274' title='Link to a copy of the speech at www.presidency.ucsb.edu' target='_blank'>speech</a> given at the Annual Dinner of the <a href='http://cpac.conservative.org/' title='Link to the Conservative Political Action Conference home page at cpac.conservative.org' target='_blank'>Conservative Political Action Conference</a> (CPAC) on March 1, 1985 he declared that the freedom fighters in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua' title='Wikipedia page for Nicaragua' target='_blank'>Nicaragua</a> &mdash; known as the <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras' title='Wikipedia page for the contras' target='_blank'>contras</a></q> &mdash; were <q>the moral equal of our Founding Fathers and the brave men and women of the French Resistance.</q></p><p>Reagan wanted to support the Nicaraguan rebels, but <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress' title='Wikipedia page for the United States Congress' target='_blank'>Congress</a> had passed the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boland_Amendment' title='Wikipedia page for the Boland Amendment' target='_blank'>Boland Amendment</a> forbidding it.  Unbeknownst to Reagan, his administration had been involved in diverting funds from arms sales to Iran to the contras in Nicaragua.</p><p>As the Blue in his spiritual portrait shows, Reagan embraced ideals &mdash; religious and patriotic ideals, specifically.  As a result, he was an optimist, and it was difficult for him to believe that people in his administration had been breaking the law by diverting funds to the contras.</p><h4>Reagan's Idealism Backfires</h4><p>As reports of the arms for hostages deals started to appear in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash-Shiraa' title='Wikipedia page for the Ash-Shiraa magazine' target='_blank'>Arab newspapers</a>, reporters in America began pressuring Reagan for answers.  Reagan responded by appearing on national television and addressing the issue in what he, at that time, thought was a direct way:</p><blockquote>The charge has been made that the United States has shipped weapons to Iran as ransom payment for the release of American hostages in Lebanon, that the United States undercut its allies and secretly violated American policy against trafficking with terrorists.  Those charges are utterly false.... We did not &mdash; repeat &mdash; did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan in an <a href='https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1986/111386c.htm' title='Link to the Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy at www.reaganlibrary.gov' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy</a>, November 13, 1986.</blockquote><p>Over the next few weeks, the people responsible for the clandestine deals were identified.  By the end of November, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter' title='Wikipedia page for John Poindexter' target='_blank'>John Poindexter</a>, Reagan's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for National Security Advisor' target='_blank'>National Security Advisor</a>, had resigned, and Reagan had fired <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North' title='Wikipedia page for Oliver North' target='_blank'>Oliver North</a>, who was one of the main people behind the malfeasance.</p><h4><q>Lax Managerial Style</q></h4><p>As time went on and more information surfaced, Ronald Reagan's popularity dropped precipitously, and he began to see past his idealism.  Eventually he realized the truth lingering on the other side of his <a href='https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rose%20colored%20glasses' title='Page for the term rose-colored glasses at www.urbandictionary.com' target='_blank'>rose-colored glasses</a>.</p><p>Amid references to parallels with Richard Nixon's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal' title='Wikipedia page for the Watergate scandal' target='_blank'>Watergate scandal</a>, on December 1, 1986 Ronald Reagan created the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Commission' title='Wikipedia page for the Tower Commission' target='_blank'>Tower Commission</a> to investigate the matter.</p><blockquote>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.  As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages.  This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.  There are reasons why it happened, but no excuses.  It was a mistake.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan in an <a href='https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/archives/speeches/1987/030487h.htm' title='Link to the text of the Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy at www.reaganlibrary.gov' target='_blank'>Address to the Nation on the Iran Arms and Contra Aid Controversy</a>, March 4, 1987.</blockquote><p>The commission's report cleared Reagan of wrong-doing, but chastised him for not being fully aware of what people working for him were actually doing.  If he was guilty of anything, it was of having a <q><a href='https://www.salon.com/2011/02/04/busby_iran_contra/' title='Link to an article about the Iran-contra scandal at www.salon.com' target='_blank'>lax managerial style</a>.</q></p><h4>Ending the Cold War</h4><p>While this was going on, Ronald Reagan was <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Soviet_Union%E2%80%93United_States_summits#Cold_War_(1985%E2%80%931991)' title='Wikipedia page for the list of summit meetings between the US and the Soviets, cued to the section about the Cold War' target='_blank'>meeting</a> with <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev' title='Wikipedia page for Mickhail Gorbachev' target='_blank'>Mickhail Gorbachev</a>, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Communist_Party_of_the_Soviet_Union' title='Wikipedia page for General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union' target='_blank'>General Secretary</a> of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union' title='Wikipedia page for the Soviet Union' target='_blank'>Soviet Union</a>.  Of particular concern were:</p><ul><li>The <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Wall' title='Wikipedia page for the Berlin Wall' target='_blank'>Berlin Wall</a>, both an imposing physical barrier and symbolic icon of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War' title='Wikipedia page for the Cold War' target='_blank'>Cold War</a>, and</li><li>The possibility of <a href='https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N8OWQ06/' title='Link to buy On the Beach at www.amazon.com' target='_blank'>Nuclear War</a>, which posed a very real threat to all life on the planet.</li></ul><p>Reagan considered nuclear weapons to be <q><a href='http://www.thereaganvision.org/important-letters-papers/' title='Link to part of a letter quoting Nancy Reagan as saying this about Ronnie at www.thereaganvision.org' target='_blank'>totally irrational</a>,</q> and in a famous speech publicly implored the Soviet leader to <q><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tear_down_this_wall!' title='Wikipedia page for the phrase Tear down this wall' target='_blank'>tear</a></q> it down:</p><blockquote>General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate!  Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate!  Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan, in his <a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan%27s_Berlin_Wall_Speech' title='Link to the Berlin Wall Speech given by Ronald Reagan at en.wikisource.org' target='_blank'>Berlin Wall Speech</a>, given at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate' title='Wikipedia page for the Brandenburg Gate' target='_blank'>Brandenburg Gate</a>, June 12, 1987.  [The full speech is <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MDFX-dNtsM' title='Video of the Berlin Wall Speech at Brandenburg Gate on youtube.com' target='_blank'>available on youtube</a>.]</blockquote><p>Of course, Ronald Reagan's speech was not the only <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War_(1985%E2%80%931991)#Timeline_of_main_events' title='Wikipedia page for the Cold War, cued to the section containing a timeline of main events' target='_blank'>thing</a> to help bring about the end of the Berlin Wall.  But it makes an excellent focal point for understanding the sentiment about the wall at that time.</p> <h4>Reagan's Part: Logic and Ideas</h4> <p>Although he was certainly a fan of the <a href='https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/founding-fathers' title='Link to a page about the Founding Fathers at www.archives.gov' target='_blank'>Founding Fathers</a>, Ronald Reagan disagreed with <a href='https://www.biography.com/people/benjamin-franklin-9301234' title='Link to Benjamin Franklin at www.biography.com' target='_blank'>Benjamin Franklin</a>'s sentiment, expressed in a Letter to Josiah Quincy dated September 11, 1783, that <q><a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/benjamin_franklin_108416' title='Link to this quote at www.brainyquote.com' target='_blank'>There never was a good war or a bad peace</a>.</q>  Not only was Franklin's wisdom a relic of a time long before the possibility of <a href='http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/history/cold-war/strategy/strategy-mutual-assured-destruction.htm' title='Link to a page about mutually assured destruction at www.nuclearfiles.org' target='_blank'>mutually assured destruction</a>, it might also imply a willingness to submit to the Soviet Empire's aggression, which was clearly unacceptable.</p> <p>If Reagan was going to call for peace, it would be a peace on his terms &mdash; terms that would not compromise his <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_patriotism' title='Wikipedia page for American patriotic ideals' target='_blank'>patriotic ideals</a> or any of the freedoms Americans had grown accustomed to over the nation's past 200+ years.</p> <p>When Mikhail Gorbachev took charge of the Soviet Union in the 1980s, he introduced two important reforms: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasnost' title='Wikipedia page for glasnost' target='_blank'>glasnost</a>, which called for more openness and transparency in Soviet society and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perestroika' title='Wikipedia page for perestroika' target='_blank'>perestroika</a>, which called for more freedom in the economy.</p> <p>Reagan's part in this was to:</p> <ul><li>recognize that Gorbachev's reforms offered the opportunity to move past the previous administrations' policies of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tente' title='Wikipedia page for detente' target='_blank'>detente</a></li><li>visualize a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Defense_Initiative' title='Wikipedia page for the Strategic Defense Initiative' target='_blank'>space-based defensive system</a>.</li></ul> <blockquote>What if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant U.S. retaliation to deter a Soviet attack, that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?
