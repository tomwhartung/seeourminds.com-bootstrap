In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he told 11,345 striking air traffic controllers to return to work within 48 hours, and fired them when they refused to do so.",
      "explain_aux": "The Blue in Ronald Reagan's spiritual portrait represents his auxiliary personality trait, his very slight preference for seeing the world more in terms of ideas than of facts.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this trait when he came up with the Stratigic Defense Initiative, in his deeply held Christian beliefs, and in the way he delegated many of the details in the day-to-workings of the White House to his subordinates.",

And as the other colors show &mdash; Reagan's Blue and Nixon's Yellow in particular &mdash; they were quite different in others.</p><h4>Anti-Communist and Peacemaker</h4> <p>After serving first in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Reserve' title='Wikipedia page for the Army Reserve' target='_blank'>Army Reserve</a>, then later in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces' title='Wikipedia page for the Army Air Forces' target='_blank'>Army Air Forces</a> during <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II' title='Wikipedia page for World War II' target='_blank'>World War II</a>, Reagan caught up in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Scare' title='Wikipedia page for the Red Scare' target='_blank'>anti-communist fervor</a> that prevailed in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s.  As President of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild' title='Wikipedia page for the Screen Actors Guild' target='_blank'>Screen Actors Guild</a> from 1947 through 1959, Reagan's politics caused him to lose <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyman' title='Wikipedia page for Jane Wyman' target='_blank'>his first wife</a> and meet <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Reagan' title='Wikipedia page for Nancy Reagan' target='_blank'>his second one</a> in 1949.</p> <p>Reagan was Governor of California during the violent <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Park_(Berkeley)#May_15,_1969:_&quot;Bloody_Thursday&quot;' title='Wikipedia page for the protests at Peoples Park in Berkeley, cued to the section about Bloody Thursday on May 15, 1969' target='_blank'>protests at People's Park</a> in Berkeley in the late 1960s.  Like his fellow <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)' title='Wikipedia page for the Republican party in America' target='_blank'>Republican</a> Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan leveraged this distruption by campaigning as a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_order_(politics)' title='Wikipedia page for law-and-order in politics' target='_blank'>law-and-order</a> candidate.</p> <p>This is not to imply that Reagan was an enemy of peace.  As the Green in his spiritual portrait shows, he was logical &mdash; he certainly wanted peace, but unlike the protesters did not think it was right to get all emotional about it.</p> <blockquote>I believe with all my heart that our first priority must be world peace, and that use of force is always and only a last resort, when everything else has failed, and then only with regard to our national security.<br />&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;Ronald Reagan, in his <a href='http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-28-1980-debate-transcript' title='Link to the presidential debate between Reagan and Carter at www.debates.org' target='_blank'>presidential debate</a> with Jimmy Carter, October 28, 1980.</blockquote> <p>In the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXBswFfh6AY' title='Video of A Time for Choosing on youtube.com' target='_blank'>A Time for Choosing</a> speech Reagan gave supporting <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Goldwater' title='Wikipedia page for Barry Goldwater' target='_blank'>Barry Goldwater</a> in 1964, he quotes <a href='/image/4900-politicians-founding_fathers/4903/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Alexander Hamilton on this site'>Alexander Hamilton</a>, Patrick Henry, and Winston Churchill in explaining that Goldwater desired not just peace, but <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1964/09/04/text-of-goldwaters-speech-formally-opening-presidential-campaign.html' title='Link to the text of Goldwaters speech formally opening his presidential campaign at www.nytimes.com' target='_blank'>peace through strength</a>.</p> <h4>Crisis: Iran-Contra</h4> <p>Iran-Contra.
