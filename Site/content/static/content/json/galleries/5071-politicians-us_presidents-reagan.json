In Extraverts, the dominant trait is directed outwardly, and spiritual portraits use a long vertical line to represent this, because it is the side of their personality that is most evident.  He demonstrated this trait when he told 11,345 striking air traffic controllers to return to work within 48 hours, and fired them when they refused to do so.",
      "explain_aux": "The Blue in Ronald Reagan's spiritual portrait represents his auxiliary personality trait, his very slight preference for seeing the world more in terms of ideas than of facts.  In Extraverts, the auxiliary trait is directed inwardly, and spiritual portraits use a horizontal line to represent this.  He demonstrated this trait when he came up with the Stratigic Defense Initiative, in his deeply held Christian beliefs, and in the way he delegated many of the details in the day-to-workings of the White House to his subordinates.",
