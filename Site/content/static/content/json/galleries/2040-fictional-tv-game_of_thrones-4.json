      "story_html": "<p>When I think about idealistic people, I like to think about people such as <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5006/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site' target='_blank'>Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5020/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Abraham Lincoln on this site' target='_blank'>Abraham Lincoln</a>.  Joffrey is clearly a different sort of idealist.</p><blockquote>[To Sansa Stark:] Congratulations, my lady.  Well, you've done it.  You've married a Lannister.  Soon you'll have a Lannister baby.  It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day.  I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you.  Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out.  How'd you like that?  You wouldn't?  That's all right.  Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.</blockquote><p>It's difficult to imagine anyone &mdash; and especially someone with integrity like Tom or Abe &mdash; saying something like that to a woman, regardless of her background!</p><p>This example illustrates the fact that the personality assessment I am using to draw these images does not measure a person's integrity, or how sociopathic they may be.</p><p>The source of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon' title='Wikipedia page for Joffrey' target='_blank'>Joffrey's</a> idealism lies in his dark imagination.  He lives in a world of his own invention, and as a cruel king with absolute power, virtually no one dares to confront his fantasies with the truth.</p><blockquote>They say Stannis never smiles.  I'll give him a red smile, from ear to ear.</blockquote><p>Given that <a href='/image/2050-fictional-tv-game_of_thrones-5/2052/' title='Link to spiritual portrait of Stannis Baratheon on this site' target='_blank'>Stannis Baratheon</a> is a seasoned veteran of numerous battles, and Joffrey is just a skinny, arrogant teenager, this quote of his is actually rather humorous.  It's worth noting though that any humor here is totally lost on poor Sansa.</p><p>I suspect there are other idealists in Westeros whose personalities are also dark in nature.  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petyr_Baelish' title='Wikipedia page for Petyr Baelish aka. Littlefinger' target='_blank'>Petyr <q>Littlefinger</q> Baelish</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melisandre' title='Wikipedia page for Melissandre' target='_blank'>Melissandre</a> come to mind as characters I believe <em>might</em> turn out to have spiritual portraits with a bit of Blue.</p><p>Another character on the show whom I suspect might be an idealist is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samwell_Tarly' title='Wikipedia page for John Tarly' target='_blank'>John Tarly</a>, who in a recent episode told Olly that <span class='air-quotes'>Wildlings are people.  Just like us, there are good ones and bad ones.</span></p><p>And then yes, there are the wildlings.  I really wish we'd seen more of Mance Rayder and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ygritte' title='Wikipedia page for Ygritte' target='_blank'>Ygritte</a>!  I can see a bit of my personal brand of idealism in their need for independence and steadfast refusal to <span class='air-quotes'>bend the knee!</span></p><p>To learn when I post new images of characters from <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones' title='Wikipedia page for Game of Thrones' target='_blank'>Game of Thrones</a> and other shows, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/seeourminds' title='Link to small form you can use to join the Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com email list' target='_blank'>join the SeeOurMinds.com email list</a>!</p>",
