Therefore, I believe it is more accurate and conveys more information than the other portrait.</p><p>In this profile, Hillary's four-letter type is ISTJ, while the <a href='/image/5100-politicians-presidential_contenders/5108/' title='Alternate spiritual portrait of Hillary Clinton on this site' target='_blank'>other portrait of Hillary</a> shows her as an ESTJ.  So as far as the four-letter type is concerned, the only difference is that this one is Introverted.</p><p>As an Introvert myself, it is difficult to imagine running for president, and constantly being in the limelight.  And it's especially to imagine running against an Extravert like <a href='/image/5080-politicians-us_presidents-2000s/5084/' title='Spiritual portrait of Donald Trump on this site' target='_blank'>Donald Trump</a>.  Keirsey claims that <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5003/' title='Spiritual portrait of Thomas Jefferson on this site' target='_blank'>Jefferson</a> and <a href='/image/5000-politicians-us_presidents-1700s-1800s/5007/' title='Spiritual portrait of Abraham Lincoln on this site' target='_blank'>Lincoln</a> were Introverts, but obviously back in their day they were not constantly being hounded by the media, as candidates are today.</p><p>Despite this difference, both images exude a similar <q>mood,</q> in that they are both dominated by Green and Yellow.  Although I do not yet have a profile for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders' title='Wikipedia page for Bernie Sanders' target='_blank'>Bernie Sanders</a>, I am sure it would look significantly different from Hillary's, because he is idealistic and passionate.</p><p>And indeed, an <a href='https://www.truity.com/blog/personality-types-presidential-candidates' title='Link to article at truity.com claiming Bernie Sanders is an INFJ' target='_blank'>article at truity.com</a> claims Bernie is an INFJ, an <a href='http://www.personalitypathways.com/article/bernie-sanders-mbti-type.html' title='Link to article at personalitypathways.com claiming Bernie Sanders is an INFJ' target='_blank'>article at personalitypathways.com</a> claims he is an INFP, and an <a href='https://www.theodysseyonline.com/mbti-personality-types-presidential-candidates' title='Link to article at theodysseyonline.com claiming Bernie Sanders is an INFJ or INFP' target='_blank'>article at theodysseyonline.com</a> claims he is an INFJ or INFP.</p><p>So if we believe Bernie is an INFJ or INFP &mdash; and that certainly sounds reasonable to me &mdash; Blue and Red would dominate his spiritual portrait, and it would definitely exude a much different <q>mood</q> than Hillary's.</p><p>It takes a long time to develop one of these profiles, generate the image for it, and explain it all in simple terms!  But perhaps if he runs in 2020, I will add Bernie's profile to this site.</p><p>To be sure to see his portrait if and when I add it, follow this site on social media or <a href='https://groja.com/conversion/seeourminds' title='Link to small form you can use to join the Groja.com and SeeOurMinds.com email list' target='_blank'>join the SeeOurMinds.com email list</a>!</p>",
