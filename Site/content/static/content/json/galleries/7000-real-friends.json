And I regret to note that I say \"was\" because Jim passed away April 5th, 2002.  I am certain that I am not alone in missing him very much!"

A quick googling confirms that Roy is still a Libertarian who continues to lobby in Richmond Virginia for gun rights and the legalization of marijuana.  Here is an image of his personality.  One might think that marijuana legalization would be a passionate issue, but his portrait shows that, for him at least, it was largely a matter of logic."
