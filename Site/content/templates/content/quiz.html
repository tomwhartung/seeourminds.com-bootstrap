         Answer all 88 questions to the best of your ability.</p>
      <p>
        This is an experimental quiz!
        (The main reason it's online at this time is so I can
         get some feedback on it.&sup1;)
        So please do not take the results too seriously!</p>

      &sup1; We will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day,

      Moreover, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result.
      I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz, coming up with the
       questions, without stealing from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey, and even
       more so with writing code to support having a varying number of options
       to some of the questions (rather than just either/or options).
      But it definitely needs more work!</p>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
       by all means take the

  <h3>What?!?</h3>
  <p>
    If you miss the old site and want to ressurect it on your own server, you can do it:
    most of the code is available
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung" class="aside"
       title="My github page" target="blank">
      on github</a>!

       title="The seeourminds.com-joomla repo on github" target="blank">
      seeourminds.com-joomla repo</a>,
    contains the core code used by the old site, and the
    <a href="https://github.com/tomwhartung?page=1&q=joomoo&tab=repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93&utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=joomoo"  class="aside"
       title="List of my github repos with names containing 'joomoo'" target="blank">
      joomoo* repos</a>
    contain the code for most of the extensions.
    For more information about these, see my
