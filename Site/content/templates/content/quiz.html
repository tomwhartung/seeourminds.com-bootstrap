    <h1>Disclaimer, Accuracy, Etc.</h1>
    <p>
      To be perfectly honest, the main reason this quiz is online at this time
        is so I can get some feedback on it.
      I suppose we will come up with some sort of official disclaimer some day,
       for now, please just take things with a grain of salt.</p>
    <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="air-quotes">Most importantly, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result!</span></p>
    <h3>If accuracy is important to you...</h3>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
        by all means take the
        <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/take-the-mbti-instrument/"
           target="_blank" title="Site where you can take the real MBTI instrument">
        real MBTI&reg; instrument</a>!</p>
    <h3>
      I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz!</h3>
    <p>
      It's been a real challenge to come up with the questions
       without borrowing too heavily from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey &mdash; and
       I love a good challenge!</p>
    <p>
      And I've had even more fun with writing the code to support having a
       different type of quiz!
      Note that it allows visitors to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Answer a varying number of questions.</li>
      <li>
        Pick from a varying number of options
        (rather than just two either/or options).
      </li>
      <li>
        Opt-out of answering some of the more experimental (fun) questions that
        appear towards the end, in the longer versions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But I am definitely not willing to claim it is accurate,
        at least, not yet!</p>
