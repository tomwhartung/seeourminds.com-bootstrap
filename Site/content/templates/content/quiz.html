         Answer all 88 questions to the best of your ability.</p>
      <p>
        This is an experimental quiz!
        (The main reason it's online at this time is so I can
         get some feedback on it.&sup1;)
        So please do not take the results too seriously!</p>

      Moreover, this quiz is a work in progress, and at this time
        I am not by any means ready to guarantee that it
        will give you an accurate result.
      I've had a lot of fun writing this quiz, coming up with the
       questions, without stealing from Briggs-Meyers and Keirsey, and even
       more so with writing code to support having a varying number of options
       to some of the questions (rather than just either/or options).
      But it definitely needs more work!</p>
    <p>
      If accuracy is important to you, please take other quizzes and
        get a variety of opinions.
      And if you really want to learn exactly what your four letter type is,
       by all means take the
