## This Is Part 3

This part contains some guidelines for the stories that appear with the Gallery images on SeeOurMinds.com .

- For part 1, general information, see https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/Site/doc/gallery_text-1-general.md
- For part 2, about the short text fields, see https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/Site/doc/gallery_text-2-nuggets.md

I will take care of all short descriptions.  They are optional, but I want to have them for consistency, and
I want them to "sound" and be consistent, to a certain extent, for all images.

**Just let me know if what I put there is wrong or if you don't like it.**

# The SeeOurMinds.com Story Is Optional

Like the other text fields ("nuggets"), the story is optional.
Having good stories though, is what makes the site consistent and much more worth while.

**Unless you want me to leave it blank, the story is the part I need help with.**

# Examples: My Favorite Stories

For examples of the best stories, see the images in the galleries nearest the top of the list of "All" of them.

I am very happy with some of the stories in the Game of Thrones and Sopranos galleries, but they took a long time to write.

# Story Guidelines

Stories appear on the image page only.

The story can contain html.  This means stories can contain links, quotes, headings, bullet or
numbered lists, images, videos, etc. - anything that can appear on a web page.

At this time, however, the stories on the site currently contain only links and quotes.

## Length

The story can be as long or as short as you like.

- I can leave it totally empty, which causes the button to be removed completely.

- If it is going to be more than one paragraph, it should have an arc: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

- It should be as positive as possible.
- - At least, anything negative should have a corresponding positive aspect to balance it.

## Quotes Are Excellent

I am finding it's best to put quotes in the stories on the site.  This makes the story more authentic and easier to do.

**Do you have a favorite quote, or maybe a "theme song?"**

If you want to embed a youtube video, that is cool, but at this time would be a first.

## Links Are Also Excellent

If you want to promote your business or a website, it would be great to link to that in the story.

- If you want to mention your favorite movie, tv show, band, sports team, etc., it would be fun to link to that in the story.

- If you want to get people join one of your social networking sites, it would be great to link to that to the story.

## Showing How It Applies

If a hobby or other favorite activity applies, we should mention that.

- If people frequently get the wrong impression of you somehow - especially if you're introverted - this would be a good time to "set the record straight."

- If one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type resonates with you, that would be great to mention.

- Similarly, if one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type DOES NOT resonate with you, that would be great to mention - but I'd want to have a positive to balance out any negativity.

- If you emphathize or idolize one or a few of the fictional characters on the site, that would be great to mention.  The opposite holds as well, although I don't want to have a negative without a positive to balance it out.
