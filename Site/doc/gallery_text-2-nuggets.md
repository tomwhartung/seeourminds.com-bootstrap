"Nuggets" are short text fields.

# SeeOurMinds.com Nuggets Guidelines

Following are some guidelines for the short text fields (aka. "nuggets") that appear with the Gallery images on SeeOurMinds.com .

# Short Text Fields Are Important

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

# Specific Fields

I will take care of all short descriptions.

**Just let me know if what I put there is wrong or if you don't like it.**
