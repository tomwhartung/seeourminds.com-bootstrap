"Nuggets" are short text fields.

# SeeOurMinds.com Nuggets Guidelines

Following are some guidelines for the short text fields (aka. "nuggets") that appear with the Gallery images on SeeOurMinds.com .

# Short Text Fields Are Important

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.

# Specific Fields

I will take care of all short descriptions.

**Just let me know if what I put there is wrong or if you don't like it.**

## Gallery Page and Image Page

- `title` Image Title, i.e., Person's Name - text only (no html)
- `subtitle_html` Image Sub-title - may contain html (e.g., a link)

## Gallery Page Only

- `gallery_page_teaser` Gallery Page Teaser - text only (no html)

## Image Page Only

- `meat_portrait_href` activates the "Show the Meat Portrait" button - link to photo, I leave this blank by default
- - **Let me know if you want to link to a photo on this site or another (e.g. Facebook)**
