## This Is Part 3

This part contains some guidelines for the stories that appear with the Gallery images on SeeOurMinds.com .

- For part 1, general information, see https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/Site/doc/gallery_text-1-general.md
- For part 2, about the short text fields, see https://github.com/tomwhartung/seeourminds.com/blob/master/Site/doc/gallery_text-2-nuggets.md

# SeeOurMinds.com Story Guidelines

Like the other text fields ("nuggets"), the story is optional.
Having good stories though, makes it much worth while.

**Unless you want me to leave it blank, the story is the part I need help with.**

For examples of the best stories, see the images in the galleries nearest the top of the list of "All" of them.

# Story: on the Image Page Only

The story can contain html.  However, most of the stories on the site currently contain only links and quotes.

Stories can contain headings, bullet or numbered lists, images, videos, etc., but at this time none of the other images have any of those.

## Length

The story can be as long or as short as you like.

- I can leave it totally empty, which causes the button to be removed completely.

- If it is going to be more than one paragraph, it should have an arc: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

- It should be as positive as possible.  At least, anything negative should have a corresponding positive aspect to balance it.

- I am finding it's best to put quotes in the stories on the site.  This makes them authentic and easier to do.

## Links Are Good

If you want to promote your business or a website, it would be great to link to that in the story.

- If you want to mention your favorite movie, tv show, band, sports team, etc., it would be fun to link to that in the story.

- If you want to get people join one of your social networking sites, it would be great to link to that to the story.

## Showing How It Applies

If a hobby or other favorite activity applies, we should mention that.

- If people frequently get the wrong impression of you somehow - especially if you're introverted - this would be a good time to "set the record straight."

- If one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type resonates with you, that would be great to mention.

- Similarly, if one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type DOES NOT resonate with you, that would be great to mention - but I'd want to have a positive to balance out any negativity.

- If you emphathize or idolize one or a few of the fictional characters on the site, that would be great to mention.  The opposite holds as well, although I don't want to have a negative without a positive to balance it out.
