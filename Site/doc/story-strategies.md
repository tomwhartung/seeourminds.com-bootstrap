## SeeOurMinds.com Story Guidelines

Following are some guidelines for the stories that appear with the Gallery images on SeeOurMinds.com :

## General

### Goals

These are the goals of all descriptive text on the site:

1. Transparency
2. Putting each tidbit of information in the correct place

### Ideally and Realistically

Ideally, each image should be able to stand on its own.

Realistically, without some sort of context, each image is "just a bunch of squares."

#### The Strategy: Compromise

I use the following compromises to balance the ideal with reality:

- Have several specific short descriptions
- Have a long story for each image

All fields are optional.

## Specific Fields

### Short Descriptions

I will take care of all short descriptions.

**Just let me know if what I put there is wrong or if you don't like it.**

#### Gallery Page and Image Page

- `Title` Image Title, i.e., Person's Name - text only (no html)
- `subtitle_html` Image Sub-title - may contain html (e.g., a link)

#### Gallery Page Only

- `gallery_page_teaser` Gallery Page Teaser - text only (no html)

#### Image Page Only

- `explain_dom` Explain Dominant Color/Function - text only (no html)
- `explain_aux` Explain Auxiliary Color/Function - text only (no html)

### Long Descriptions - Stories

#### Image Page Only

The story can be as long or as short as you like.

- I can leave it totally empty, which causes the button to be removed completely.

- If it is going to be more than one paragraph, it should have an arc: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

- It should be as positive as possible.  At least, anything negative should have a corresponding positive aspect to balance it.

- I am finding it's best to put quotes in the stories on the site.  This makes them authentic and easier to do.

### Links Are Good

If you want to promote your business or a website, it would be great to link to that in the story.

- If you want to mention your favorite movie, tv show, band, sports team, etc., it would be fun to link to that in the story.

- If you want to get people join one of your social networking sites, it would be great to link to that to the story.

### Showing How It Applies

If a hobby or other favorite activity applies, we should mention that.

- If people frequently get the wrong impression of you somehow - especially if you're introverted - this would be a good time to "set the record straight."

- If one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type resonates with you, that would be great to mention.

- Similarly, if one or a few of the traits or characteristics listed on the wikipedia page for your type DOES NOT resonate with you, that would be great to mention - but I'd want to have a positive to balance out any negativity.

- If you emphathize or idolize one or a few of the fictional characters on the site, that would be great to mention.  The opposite holds as well, although I don't want to have a negative without a positive to balance it out.
