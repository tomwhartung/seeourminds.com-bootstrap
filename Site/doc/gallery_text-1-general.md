## SeeOurMinds.com Text Guidelines

Following are some guidelines for the text fields that appear in the Galleries on SeeOurMinds.com :

# General

## Goals

These are the goals of all descriptive text on the site:

1. Transparency
2. Putting each tidbit of information in the correct place

## Ideally and Realistically

Ideally, each image should be able to stand on its own.

Realistically, without some sort of context, each image is "just a bunch of squares."

## The Strategy: Compromise

I use the following compromises to balance the ideal with reality:

- Have several specific short descriptions
- Have a long story for each image

# All Fields Are Optional

All fields are optional, but an image without at least a title is pretty meaningless.
